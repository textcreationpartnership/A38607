            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Subject and Division of this Treatise.</head>
                  <p>I Regard not those that copy other mens writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and impudently make them their own: As there are beggars that steal the children of good families, yea, and also maim them, to repair their low condition; so, many that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own to write, expose other mens, and say, they are the Authors thereof: What's more common then this kind of rapine? But I hope it shall appear, that I am far from this. If I say any thing hath been already writ, which may fall out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, 'tis as little as nothing; yea, I have abstained from setting down here the observations I have seen in some Writers, that come but near to the subject I now treat of. I avoid as much as possible I can such helps, and would be asham'd to crave them.</p>
                  <p>Now that I write of at this time, is not a simple Chronology, as may be imagin'd at first sight; the world is full of Chronologers, and their endeavours is but to reckon, how many years, or how long time is past since the Creation, or since Christ, or since some other famous event; this is all their Arithmetick. But we must have another, where there is more skill, without which, all Chronology is but a matter without form.</p>
                  <p>All the times since the beginning have run by certain measures and proportions, wherein lies one of the rarest secrets of History. This admirable symetry of Ages and Years, spread abroad and
<pb facs="tcp:98078:4"/>ranked with so much order, and so artificially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd about by the hand of the Antient of days, produceth reflections, which makes his incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wisdom appear.</p>
                  <p>And not onely the times, but the generations and successions, as well of Kingdoms as of Families, yea, and of persons too, are measur'd and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. And 'tis to be observed, that each Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, each Family, and each Person, is marked with a certain number, and with a particular cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. We know, that numbers are not the causes of that which falls out, but they are marks or seals that God impresseth on his works, to the end we may distinguish them by the difference of their cyphers.</p>
                  <p>The Septenary is very frequent and general, as being the number of the compleat Creation. The tenth, twelfth, the fortieth, and some other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, are by turns, for several significations. Could it be said, that the holy Ghost was pleased to note out an Empire, that afterwards caused so many troubles, and with three numeral Letters marked out the name of a man, which signifies 666?</p>
                  <p>But 'twill be said, The Scripture expresseth not these numbers but very seldom, and less the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions we speak of: Also it tells not how many Kings the Kingdom of <hi>Juda</hi> hath had before the Captivity, but onely gives the Catalogue of them from the first to the last. The Scripture speaks to those who know how to reckon. Moreover, God would have it, that the secrets of these measures, correspondencies, oppositions, and distributions of
<pb facs="tcp:98078:4"/>times, and what is enclosed in them, should be wrapt up with covers, to the end we might bring our industry to unfold them. And truly, although the study thereof be troublesome at first, yet we shall find very sweet flowers there, and also the fruits of the Tree of life.</p>
                  <p>But here's the great brunt, this the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position made to me, That Chronology that serves for the basis of my work is disputable in some points, and therefore I lay many disputable observations thereon. To which I answer, 1 That I have many good warrants for this Chronology, and that 'tis born before me. 2 That I can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and resolve the difficulties therein. 3 That in the disagreement of the Chronologers, we must always prefer the supputation, where some myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious point meets, which results from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the time. What! shall the variety of our opinions, that come from imperfection, annihilate the wonders of God?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the things I produce cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, without giving the lie to the Scripture; nor the Harmonies I have met with, without renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the skill of numbring; nor to hold them for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, without denying the providence of God; nor saying they have their causes, without blaspheming them against his wisdom.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of times shall be in the beginning of this work. Now in the first Antiquity, and also since, many things have occurr'd, that the ignorant take to be very inconsiderable. But we must know, that the first times, and what past therein, is a
<pb facs="tcp:98078:5"/>very necessary Alphabet for the most learned: All the highest matters that are, have need of an <hi>A B C</hi> to express them; as the eloquentest Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that is cannot be pronounc'd, but with the sound of the Alphabetical Letters.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as the Sun had the principal Office of marking and measuring out the times, wee'le begin with him, and 'twill appear, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was marked out and measured by the times.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards we shall see the general measures of times past since the production of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> to the Ascension of the Second; yea, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the second Temple: And after that, divers parcels of time of the Old Testament, and the matters therein contained. Then wee'le make a pause, till we come to the particular measures of the New Testament, which shall make the second part of this Treatise.</p>
                  <p>One day telleth another, and one night certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth another; how much more one Generation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and one Age another Age? Then how much more science results from the agreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert of all the Ages together, and of all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which highly correspond one with another? In the diversity also of their tones, measures, and cadencies, we shall hear an excellent and most divine Harmony.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Death, who snatch'd him away, and hindred the finishing thereof, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless caused a certain perfection to be seen, that may give admiration to some in this Age, and frustrate the hopes of others, of being able to come near the painting of such a <hi>Venus</hi> after such an <hi>Apelles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His intention was to continue this <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> to the close of the New Testament, but death seized on him when he came to that of <hi>Christ</hi>'s, and hath left us the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, of losing, with him the rest of that incomparable Peece, which I could no
<pb facs="tcp:98078:9"/>ways conceal the publishing, because so many Persons of quality, both here and beyond sea, and also of both our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, have so earnestly desired what frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments soever I had of that most excellent man. Besides this, I thought my self obliged thereunto by the honor he did me, in making me the sole Executor of his last Will and Testament.</p>
                  <p>None can be ignorant, that during these late times of horror and confusion, both in our Church and State, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Word of God was, and that in stead thereof, and the pure Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but extemporary prayers, with their Sermons stuff'd with Blasphemy, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and Sedition, where none could joyn with them without betraying his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science toward God, and his fidelity to his Prince; which obliged, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther constrained me, first, to frequent the <hi>French</hi> Church, then assembled at <hi>Durham-house,</hi> to be a partaker of those excellent Sermons and Doctrines of our Author, who then was followed by many of the Nobility, and the best of the Gentry, who rendred both to God and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> their due.</p>
                  <p>The respect I had from them of that Assembly, engaged me to abide with
<pb facs="tcp:98078:9"/>them ever since, and to take a part with them in the trouble of providing them a place to assemble in, after the demolishing of <hi>Durham-house.</hi> Which makes me remember the prophetical words of our Author, for asking him then, What we should do now for a place to assemble in, made me the same answer <hi>Abraham</hi> made to <hi>Isaac,</hi> when he said to his father,
<note place="margin">Gen. 22.7, 8.</note>
                     <hi>Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the Lamb for the burnt-offering?</hi> who replyed, <hi>Deus providebit;</hi> which presently after fell out to be true: For it pleased God to touch the hearts of many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to procure us an Order of the House of Peers, to exercise our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at <hi>Somerset-house</hi> Chappel; which was the cause not onely of driving away the <hi>Anabaptists, Quakers,</hi> and other Sects that had got in there, but also hindred the pulling down of <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> there having been twice Order from the late usurped Powers for selling the said House; but we prevailed so, that still we got order to exempt the Chappel from being sold, which broke the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of those that had bought the said House, who thought, for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, to have made a Street from the Garden, through the ground the Chappel now stands on, hand so up the
<pb facs="tcp:98078:10"/>back-yard to the great street of the <hi>Strand,</hi> by pulling down the said Chappel; but it pleased God to provide so, that still there was order to preserve this Chappel, which consequently also preserved <hi>Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things being considered, none, I hope, will blame me to relate, what I have said of a man, who hath merited so much of the publick, and of me in particular, and to revive the memory of him in his works: And when hereafter the rest shall be all printed together, I shall not fail (God-willing) to contribute thereunto all the Reliques I have by me of this excellent Author.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, seeing it hath pleased God, after so many confusions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, which happened as well in the Church as in the State, to re-establish again on the antient foundations both the one and the other, and to cause that the Church, as the floating Ark did, at last find a Mountain to rest on; or as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christ; who were the true Church, being on the Sea, and tossed by the tempest; but when Christ their beloved Master came in to them, then all was made calm again: So it hath pleased God, that not onely the Church in general hath had the effects of his goodness, but also in particular this <hi>French</hi> Church of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98078:10"/>having always maintained the purity of its Doctrine amidst such horrible confusions, and at last by his mercy, and the especial favour of his Majesty, hath found a place of rest, and a nursing Father to have care of it; obliging all the Members thereof in general continually to pour out their prayers for the preservation of his Person, the encrease of his Greatness, and the felicity of his Reign; which in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular are the real and continual humble requests of His Majesty's</p>

                     <head>The Day wherein the Sun stood still, and was to him as a Sabbath-day, hapned after the Sun was Created in the Year seven times three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sixty and five, a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that answereth the three hundred sixty and five days of the Annual Course of the Sun, as the Number Seven doth that of the Sabbath.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE History in the Tenth of <hi>Joshua,</hi> quotes the year of that miracle, but it is easie to find it. The <hi>Israelites</hi> who came out of the Wilderness, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98078:12"/>year of the Creation 2553. between which time, and that wherein the Sun stood still, many occurrences interven'd, as, their passage through <hi>Jordan,</hi> seven days spent to encompass <hi>Jericho,</hi> the siege and sacking of <hi>Ai,</hi> the Conspiration of divers Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the arming and mustering of sundry Nations to oppose <hi>Israel,</hi> the affair of the <hi>Gibbeonites,</hi> the five Kings who assaulted them, the besieging of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> the succour brought by <hi>Joshua</hi> unto them, the battel that was fought there, and other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. So many archievments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits which succeeded one another, and were before the standing still of the Sun, were the work of more than one year; if we count them to be two, as all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences do oblige us, we shall find, that it was in the year of the Creation 2555. when the Sun stood still. Now these 2555 are seven times 365, or 365 weeks of years.</p>
                     <p>And grant that this Miracle should have fallen out a little sooner, to wit, in the year 2554, it was nevertheless towards the end of the last 365 weeks of years, which answers the days of the annual course of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>When we say 365 days, we implicitly understand the five hours and the minutes which are above the 365 days; for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98078:12"/>had also her intercalcations of days, and her embolisms or interjections of months; and the Scripture presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth them, when it makes mention of numbers of years. But we onely express 365 days, to avoid the frequent repetition of the hours and minutes, which are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary. So we also understand, that every one of these years containeth 365 days, 5 hours, and about 49 minutes.</p>
                     <p>But as for that great wonder, which is now under our consideration, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the time wherein it fell out, doth yet render it more illustrious. Truly 'tis not wonderful, that the Sun being about to finish the 365 weeks of the years of his course, hath had a day of Rest: Man was commanded to rest himself on the seventh day, the ground doth rest on the seventh year, and the Sun going about to finish seven times as many years as he employeth days to perfect a year, hath had a command to rest for the space of one day.</p>
                     <p>This measure, which containeth 365 years, may be called a year of years; as 365 days do make up an ordinary year, which is a year of days, so 365 years do make up a year of years. We do give it this name, although it be not textual, nor expressed in the Scriptures, or in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chronology. Words are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98078:13"/>provided they be intelligible. And this the Sun going about to finish his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of years, stood still to rest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, the wisdom of God was so pleased that this miracle should be at such a time rather then at any other. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in commanding the Sun to make an halt, was chiefly, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> might have light, whereby they might the better be enabled to pursue their enemies. But this reason, although expressed alone, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not those which accompany it. In so many other occasions, where the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranlites</hi> had need of the standing still of the Sun, God was never pleased at all to work this wonder. And to demonstrate, that God had a further aime herein, than onely the compleating the victory of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi> we ought to consider, what is easie to observe, that all the earth hath felt this prodigy; for whilst one part of the world beheld this long day, the other part had as long a night. What then hath been the cause of this strange interruption of the course of the Sun? The greatest part of the world adored that flaming body as a Deity, the ceasing of its motion tended to declare, that there was a Superior who could stop his course, and inhibit and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his operations.</p>
                     <p>This Miracle, moreover, did fall out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98078:13"/>most conveniently at that time; the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were newly entred into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> full of Idolaters, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd with Nations that ador'd the Sun, the Moon, and all the Host of Heaven; God, by this, advertis'd his people, that they should not suffer themselves to be drawn away to such abominations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2, 3. And to confute them by a visible and irrefragible argument, caused both the Sun and the Moon to stand still at the word of a man.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet a more special reason why this miracle fell out at the time we have mentioned. The Septenary num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Times, Days, Years, and Ages, and of their periods and Revolutions, is a character whereby we know God hath marked most of his works. 'Tis remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd of the Rest God took the seventh day, having finish'd the Creation: For this cause he would have the Sun, who is the measure of days and years, should rest one day in his seventh year of years, even then when he had accomplish'd his 365 weeks of years, or seven times 365 years; seven times as many years as he had run days in one year. Finally, as every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year was a year of Sabbath, the Sun observed a Sabbath in the seventh year of his 365 weeks of years, which was a year of Sabbath.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98078:14"/>
                     <p> How much light meeteth in this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Sabbath of the Sun! that Luminary which giveth light to all the rest of the world, was it self enlightned on that day. <hi>He knoweth the time of his going down, Psal.</hi> 104.19. but did not know till then there should be a day wherein his setting should be later than ordinary. The Sun did never give so much light to our eyes, as these considerations do bestow on our spirits.</p>
                     <p>Behold then an admirable concurrence; 365 annual days, 365 years answering thereunto; 365 weeks of years, or seven times 365 years expired when the Sun stood still; then did his cipher meet with that of the Sabbath, the number of three hundred and sixty five being measured by sevens.</p>
                     <p>But let us behold another miracle which he hath shewed us in Heaven.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>In the Tenth Year of the Tenth Year of Years, expired since the Creation, the Sun went back Ten Degrees, <hi>Isa. 38.8.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BEhold yet a wonder that parallels or surpasses the former, it fell out, the Sun being 3295 years old.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98078:14"/>
                     <p> Let us calculate, as above; the term of 365 is a year of years, for 3285 years are nine times 365. ten years after, which was in the year 3285, hapned the going back of that great Luminary. These ten years were then the first of the tenth year of years expired since the Creation. So that when the Sun did go back, he was come to the tenth year of his tenth year of years; and the ten degrees of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradation did seem clearly to signifie it. In short, in the tenth year of the tenth year of years, the Sun went back by ten degrees. What man is so stupid, that's not ravished in admiration of so celestial an Harmony.</p>
                     <p>Add to this, that in this Interval of ten years, which ended in the retrograda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, hapned the transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ten Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> that were carried away into <hi>Assyria.</hi>

                     <head>The History of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of Ten Prophetical Years; and from the ending of it unto the death of Christ, there is the space of another Prophetical Year.</head>
                     <p>IN the Language of the Prophets, one day is often taken for a year, and the Prophetical year is of 360 solary years. For Example, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.6, 14. <hi>One thousand two hundred and sixty days are a time, and times, and half a time;</hi> that is to say, three Prophetical years and a half, three hundred and sixty Solary years being taken for one Prophetical year.</p>
                     <p>Now, why God accounts 360 ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary years for one onely year Prophetical, we might find a conjecture in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of a natural revolution, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within such a term. For at the end of 360 years, and no sooner, the measure of the Lunary year, according to Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, doth meet with that of the Sun. But there is a nearer, and more manifest reason thereof: Amongst the Hebrews, the year which they called Civil, was onely of 360 days; as for the five supernumerary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98078:15"/>days, they were to be found in every sixth year, adding to it a month, which was called Embolismical. And as for the hours that are above the 365 annual days, there was yet another Embolism, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to supply them, at the end of one hundred and twenty years; or from time to time they interserted one or more days: as then the ordinary year was of 360 days, the Prophetical year was of 365 natural years. So from the Creation to the year 3600, there are ten Prophetick years, or ten times 365 Solary years. Now the History of the Old Testament doth end with the tenth Prophetical year. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the question is now, and not according to the order wherein the Books are ranked, the last Date of the History of the Old Testament is of the Reign of <hi>Darius Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domannus,</hi> the last King of <hi>Persia, Nehem.</hi> 12.22. This Prince Reigned but six years, and was overcome by <hi>Alexander</hi> in the year of the world 3600, which was the last year of the tenth Prophetical year, there being ten times 360 years complete. And there the History of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment endeth.</p>
                     <p>From thence to the death of Christ, in the year of the Creation 3960, there precisely passed another Prophetical year; For from the year 3600, where at the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98078:16"/>tenth Prophetical year expired, to the year 3960, there are 360 years, which are yet one Prophetical year, which is the interval that is found between the ending of the Old Testament, and the exhibition of the New, when Christ seal'd it with his Blood.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Holy History having begun from the original of Times, did go on till it came to the end of the ten Prophetical years; there it rested, and became silent for the space of another Prophetical year, which ended at the death of Christ, and was followed by the writing of the New Testament. This measure of time was as a Tenth of years proportionated and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to all those that went before. And thus as Christ was drawing near to shut up the Prophecies, the which he did by his Death, and his Exaltation, the Pen of the Prophets rested during the space of one Prophetical year.</p>

                        <p> True it is, that the History of the Old Testament, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.19. doth name <hi>Pedaia</hi> the father of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> in stead of <hi>Salathiel,</hi> who was his uncle; nevertheless 'tis manifest, that in numbring upwards from Christ to the Captivity, wherein was the father of <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> there are precisely two and twenty Generations.</p>
                        <p>Thus, further to recapitulate all the parts of this Divine Oeconomy, we do therein observe,</p>
                        <p>Before the Church became a Nation, 22 Patriarchs.</p>
                        <p>From the Institution of the Priesthood untill the destruction of the first Temple, 22 Generations in the High Priesthood.</p>
                        <p>From the entrance of <hi>Israel</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi> unto the first King, 22 Judges or Governors.</p>
                        <p>Since the beginning of Kingship to the suppression of it, 22 Kings.</p>
                        <p>Since the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> unto Christ, 22 Generations.</p>
                        <p>This is also very remarkable: In the two and twenty Generations of the world, God renewed the Promise touching the Seed of the woman. For <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was the two and twentieth Patriarch, did speak of <hi>Shilo,</hi> the Seed of the woman, who was to come. And the two and twentieth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, after that the Ancestors of <hi>Shilo</hi> were transported to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98078:19"/>the Promise seemed to be annihilated, was <hi>Shiloh</hi> himself. The first twenty two Generations had in their beginning the Promise touching the Son of the Virgin, and concluded with a second Promise touching the Son of the Virgin, and the last two and twenty Generations, ended by the exhibition of the Son of the Virgin.</p>

                     <head>All the Generations of Christ, even comprehending therein that which is from the days of Eternity, are <hi>77,</hi> ranked and distinguished from seven to seven.</head>
                     <p>THe Genealogy of our Saviour (which is here treated of) doth go up a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree higher, and is infinitely higher than any other which we read of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98078:20"/>his Son. If we begin where the Evangelist ends (which is indifferent) we shall find, that the seventy seven Generations of the Son of God are divided into sevens, whereof every one, for the most part, beginneth with some mysterious point, relating to the Person of Christ. This is the order of the Degrees.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Most of these Septenaries do begin by some illustrious mark of the Person of Christ, who was to close the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.</p>
                     <p>The first doth begin in God himself, to show the Generation of his Son.</p>
                     <p>The second doth begin with <hi>Enoc,</hi> the seventh man from <hi>Adam,</hi> the third who went out of the world, and the first that in his body went up into Heaven; Christ the third who went up bodily into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was the seventh after <hi>Adam</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.</p>
                     <p>The third doth begin with <hi>Heber;</hi> in the time of his life hapned the confusion of the Tongues in <hi>Babel.</hi> Christ, after his Ascension into heaven, did work a quite contrary wonder, bestowing the gift of Tongues.</p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98078:21"/>
                     <p>The fourth doth begin with <hi>Isaac,</hi> the first who was miraculously conceived, as the fore-runner of a greater wonder hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned since, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conception of the <hi>Messias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth doth begin with the coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the celebrating of the first Passeover, a figure of Christ sacrific'd for us; at that time lived <hi>Naasson,</hi> the chief of the Tribe of <hi>Juda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixth, seventh, and eighth have their beginning, where the old Testament ceased to prosecute the Genealogy of our Lord. For the Old Testament having mentioned one of the sons of <hi>David,</hi> to wit, <hi>Nathan,</hi> from whom Christ is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, it doth not give an account of those that came from him, but of two or three onely, and those remote from him by many degrees. Therefore the New Testament beginneth the Catalogue where the Old began to be silent; to wit, at the entrance of the seventh Septenary.</p>
                     <p>The ninth, the tenth, and the last, have their beginning at the return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Zorobabel;</hi> a Deliverance hapned by vertue of the Alliance, since written with Christs own blood, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the wonderful particulars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this Genealogy, this may be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98078:21"/>observed; we know the Scripture marketh the time of the coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> as a period, in diverse respects most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.1. if then we do num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Generations onely from the coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> unto Christ, we find forty nine Cenerations, which are seven times seven; a very significant number, and fit to represent the fulness of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations which end in Christ: Let us also see it further in the fulness of Times in the following Observation.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Since the Promise touching the Seed of the Woman unto the accomplishment, when the Virgin conceived, there passed seven years, or a week of years, seven times seventy years, seventy weeks of years, and yet seven times seventy weeks of years.</head>
                     <p>HE that knoweth the style of God, and how he doth set the times in orders will not find this Arithmetick to be strange. In divers places, as well of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98078:22"/>the New as the Old Testament (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14.) he nameth the measure of a <hi>time, and times, and half a time;</hi> all which doth amount unto three years and a half.</p>
                     <p>But why did he not express it more briefly by the total sum, and not by such parcels and broken numbers? There are many weighty reasons for it, which we will touch in the due place. So likewise, why doth it suffice to speak the total num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the years which hath passed since the Creation, without dividing them into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal parts? The bare view of the total doth not shew the proportions and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations from one unto the other; and from their inequality there doth a melody result.</p>
                     <p>It is a phrase which seemeth to have been proverbial, even since the beginning of the world, to exaggerate, or to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie a matter, by putting one seven fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by seventy times seven; <hi>Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, but Lamech seventy and seven-fold, Gen.</hi> 4.24. And our Lord commandeth to forgive, <hi>not onely seven times, but seventy times seven, Matth.</hi> 18.22. The like multiplication may be observed in the most of God's works, especially in the oeconomy of Times, and that for the causes above mentioned. As for the present subject, we do set the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98078:22"/>of Christ in the year of the world 3928. a little after the beginning of the said year. If we abate the months of Christ's being in his mothers womb, it will follow, that he was conceived in the year 3927.

                     <head>Several measures of the Time, which the patience of God doth give unto sinners, before he punisheth them.</head>
                     <p>TO the whole world he gave three times forty years, before he sent the Deluge; there were the 120 years which God did mark out unto them; but unto the <hi>Amorites</hi> he gave ten times forty years, till their iniquity was fulfilled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. To the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after they had procured the death of the Lord of Glory, he gave forty years before he ruined their estate. To <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> he allowed one year before he deprived him of his sense, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. But to a City, <hi>viz.

                     <p>Such measures, and their variety, have their various causes, unknown to us; that we might speak of them, we should be informed of the quality of the crimes committed, of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98078:28"/>which are seven times 120, seven times as much time as God had given to the men of the old world, when he threatned the Deluge.</p>

                     <p>AFter the nativity of <hi>Enoc,</hi> the son of <hi>Seth,</hi> the son of <hi>Adam,</hi> they <hi>did begin to call on the Name of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 4.26. it was a mark of Profession which distinguished the children of God from the children of corrupted men.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98078:28"/>of men; this mixture, and the corruption which proceeded from thence, continued to the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> who was the eight Generation from <hi>Enoch</hi> inclusively.</p>
                     <p>It is also to be observed, that 960 years was then the greatest measure of the days of man, there were never but two that exceeded that age, and none other attained thereunto; so that 120 years were largely the eighth part of the greatest age of men at that time.</p>
                     <p>Thus, before the denouncing of the Deluge, the patience of God stayed till eight generations should be over, since the distinction made between the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God and the children of men; and according to the number of these Generations, he saved eight persons in the Ark; and denouncing the Deluge, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther staid the eight part of the age of man.</p>
                     <p>All this Oeconomy hath been of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of Generations, of Years, and of Persons.</p>

For the necessity occasioned by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious blood, which had taken the place of the water, forced them to dig the ground to find drink; that labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued seven whole days, so that there was no Sabbath for them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.24, 25.

                     <p>GOD, who was the Founder of their State, and the Author of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, was pleased, that the Tribes should be distinguished, more eminently the Royal Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> and the Sacerdotal of <hi>Levi.</hi> That distinction was necessary for many weighty reasons, yet many times it hath been the occasion of emulation and division.

                     <head>An Analogy of the seventh day, wherein no <hi>Manna</hi> fell, and of the seventh day of the hunger of a Man.</head>
                     <p>Upon the Eve of the Sabbath God had ordained <hi>Manna</hi> to be gathered for the next day, because none fell on the seventh day; the manifest reason of that intermission was the holiness of the day of Rest, inconsistent with the manual work required for gathering of <hi>Manna.</hi> But it seems there is yet another secret in that cessation on the seventh day.</p>
                     <p>'Tis certain, and there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scripture, that several di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries are inclosed in some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural secret reflecting upon them. Now 'tis the common opinion, that naturally a man cannot endure hunger above seven days, <hi>viz.</hi> untill there be no more chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or nourishing humour in his stomach, or in his intrals; if he goes beyond seven days, he dies. And because <hi>Manna</hi> did
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98078:45"/>not fall on the seventh day, he who should have neglected it during the six days it fell down, would have found none upon the seventh, and so having no other food would have been liable to death. The following observation will afford us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this.</p>

                     <p>IN the year of Jubilee, all the lands that had been alienated returned to their former owners, and therefore the price of the sale, which properly was but a Lease, was according to the number of the years wanting to the next Jubilee.

                     <p>TO come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> they were to pass through the waters of the Sea, which divided to give them a free way. To enter into <hi>Canaan</hi> they were to pass through the Channel of <hi>Jordan,</hi> the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98078:51"/>waters whereof gave place to them. And to come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> where they were Captive, the waters of <hi>Euphrates</hi> must be first turned another way, which was performed by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who to take the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> diverted the course of that River.

Thus the coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the entring into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the departure from <hi>Babylon,</hi> came to pass by the division of waters.</p>

                     <p>THe most excellent means to attain to a Conquest, is the immediate and miraculous operation of God; that which proceedeth immediately from him, even the evil it self, is always to be preferred to that which passeth through the hand of men.</p>

                     <p>The third means is, when the enemy wanting courage, doth submit without striking a blow.</p>
                     <p>The fourth means is, the force of the arm and of the sword.</p>

                     <p>WE know with what fervency <hi>David</hi> prayed, and desired the life of that Child, but could never obtain it.</p>
                     <p>We ought here to observe an effect of God's wisdom. It might have been doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether that child was <hi>David</hi>'s or not, for the time of his birth showed that he was then begotten, when <hi>Uriah,</hi> the first husband of <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> was yet alive; had that child lived, being the first son of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> he might have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>David</hi> in the Kingdom as well as <hi>Solomon,</hi> whom they had afterwards; but as his Birth might have been disputed, so his Title might have been called to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and it would have caused a great trouble in the Royal Succession.</p>
                     <p>And although no doubt had been made of his coming from <hi>David,</hi> yet being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Adultery, the Law made him incapable of the Crown; he might have had some Partizans, but he could not have wanted Competitors, armed with strong reasons, and that would have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98078:55"/>Civil Wars, which by the death of that Child were prevented.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet a higher and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reason, why God was not pleased that Child should live. Christ was to come from <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by their eldest son, for our Lord is come from <hi>Nathan,</hi> who was but a younger brother; but it was necessary, for many weighty reasons, that Jesus Christ should be comprehended in the Genealogy of the eldest, because of the Legal succession which belonged to Jesus Christ, the line of the eldest failing; and from thence it comes, that St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> in his first Chapter, naming the Ancestors of Christ, makes him to come from <hi>Solomon.</hi> Now it was not fit that Christ should succeed, either Naturally or Legally, one of whom it might be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether he came from from <hi>David,</hi> or was his lawful Successor. And upon this account was God pleased that that Child should die (though the first-born) and that on the seventh day of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>

                     <p>IN the persons of those who were raised from the dead, and of those who were bodily translated into Heaven, God hath shewed the Prologues of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection to come, and of the transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our bodies that are to be taken up into Heaven. But the Resurrection will be before that transportation. We may then demand, Why hath not God observed the same order in those won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that represented the wonders he is to work at the last times? For whereas we shall be raised from the dead, before we be taken up into Heaven, <hi>Enoc</hi> was transported into Heaven before any was raised from the dead. The first that was raised from the dead was the son of the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> at the prayer of <hi>Elija,</hi> a long time after the transportation of <hi>Enoc.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This we may say upon this with all likelihood, God in the first place hath been pleased to shew, that had it not been for sin, Man had been translated without seeing of death, as <hi>Enoc</hi> was by privilege, although he was mortal. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98078:59"/>death having yet a long time reigned, God shewed, that the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our bodies is a necessary fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of their ascension into heaven: whereof he shewed an example in two divers persons, raising one who was dead, by <hi>Elija,</hi> before <hi>Elija</hi> went up himself to heaven. He hath since continued at certain times the miracle of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, till the Ascension of Christ, and a while since too. But so it is, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the first that was raised from the dead was soon after followed by a miraculous Ascension, even of him by whom that dead was raised. And it cannot be objected, that those two wonders were not wrought upon one and the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for that was reserved till the days of Christ; before he raised himself, no man could ever be raised from the dead, to go up bodily into Heaven.</p>

                     <p>For the most part, the greater Miracles have followed others of lesser moment. The Wisdom of God hath been pleased to act by degrees, to prepare by little and little the spirits of man.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the particular Resurrection of some from the dead hath not onely been one of the greatest Miracles of God, but a Preludium of the general Resurrection which we expect.

                     <p>THe year wherein the <hi>Israelites</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> after they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98078:62"/>ended the Conquest, is a Date of great importance, necessary to measure the times of the abode of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Land of Promise. This year was the 2560 after the Creation; from that year to the going back of the Sun, at a time when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Juda</hi> was in great danger, <hi>viz.</hi> 3295. we see there passed 735 years; now 735 years do make up fifteen Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilees, every Jubilee consisting of forty nine years, which are seven times seven years.</p>
                     <p>From thence to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, which began in the year 3400, there were 105 years, which make fifteen times seven years, or fifteen weeks of years. These fifteen weeks of years began by the fifteen years miraculously added to <hi>Hezekia</hi>'s life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hezekia</hi> was the fifteenth King, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Saul,</hi> who ruled the people of God: As therefore there had then been fifteen Kings in the order of succession, so God added fifteen years to the life and reign of the fifteenth King. As for the reasons of that Analogy, I have produced them in my <hi>Observations on the Decalogue,</hi> and shall onely repeat this, That the life of <hi>Hezekia,</hi> prolonged by fifteen years, was an earnest of the subsistance of that Throne, which fifteen Kings had already sate upon.</p>
                     <p>That Throne subsisted yet after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98078:63"/>of <hi>Hezekia,</hi> seven times fifteen years to the time of the Captivity; those who reigned after the begining of the said Captivity, <hi>Jechonias</hi> and <hi>Zedekia,</hi> were but Vassalls to the Babylonian King.</p>
                     <p>Thus those fifteen years of <hi>Hezekia</hi> were the seventh part of the time that passed to the Captivity; and that time that ran to the time of the Captivity, was one seventh in comparison of the time which had passed from the conquest of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the beginning of these fifteen years of <hi>Hezekia.</hi> To conclude, from the Conquest to the going back of the Sun, where the fifteen years added to the life of <hi>Hezekia</hi> began, there were fifteen Jubilees, which were followed with fifteen weeks of years, ending at the beginning of the Captivity, and including the fifteen years of <hi>Hezekia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To all this we may add, that from the begining of the Captivity, to the last ruine of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> (forty years after the death of Christ) there was fifteen times forty years; for from the year 3400, whereat the Captivity began, to the year 4000, in which <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was destroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> there passed 600 years, which are fifteen times forty. Such have been the measures and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of times, since the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98078:63"/>put into the possession of the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> till they utterly lost it. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals have had their particular measures proportioned the one unto the other, and to a total sum of years.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>HEzekia</hi> did not accept of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but required, that the Sun might go back, as it did; many hold, that that going back was done in a moment, but that is not without dispute. It is more certain, that if the Sun had leap'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by so many degrees as God offered to his choice, it would have been in a lesser time then that Luminary doth ordinarily employ in going so long a way: For what wonder had it been if the Sun going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and following his ordinary course from East to West, had not gone swiftlier than he used to do?</p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98078:64"/>
                     <p>Now to understand how great this swiftness would have been, we must first see what were the measures of the ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees mentioned in that Story; if they were so many hours, as the <hi>Jews</hi> think, they would have been 150 Degrees in the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> line, fifteen degrees for one hour; a very long way, and which required about five of the six parts of that time the Sun employeth in one natural day.</p>
                     <p>If they were onely half hours, as most of our Interpreters do hold, yet was the Sun to run swifter than ordinary during five hours.</p>
                     <p>But a modern Writer doth much shorten it, conceiving the ten degrees to be those, which in the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> line we do account for two thirds of an hour: And so, according to his opinion, the Sun should not have gone back but onely by two thirds of an hour. And when God offered the alternative, to cause the Sun to hasten ten degrees forward, it should not have been any more than by two thirds of an hour.</p>
                     <p>Now although we should take it in this sense, which is the most diminitive that can be given to that Story, yet we should still find therein a prodigious wonder.</p>
                     <p>But we must see also, how much less than the two thirds of an hour the Sun should have spent in compassing that way.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98078:64"/>It is the most common opinion, that the Sun should have leaped in a moment of time, which is as much as to say, That in a moment he had made as much rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his way, as he is used to do in two thirds of an hour. And certainly the miracle, which God offered, did consist in this, that the Sun should dispatch his way in as short a time as possibly he could.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon the Philosophers will deny, that a local motion can be made in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let it be granted, but the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the longest motion may be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, God impelling a body to such a degree, that the motion shall be perfected in a time almost imperceivable by its shortness.</p>
                     <p>Instead of a moment let us put the case, that the Sun leaping forward had spent therein a minute, and that his way had been but the two thirds of an hour; in that one minute he had dispatched as much way as he had done naturally in forty minutes, which are the two thirds of an hour; and thus his swiftness had been forty times greater then that of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary motion. Nay let us suppose, that he had employed ten minutes to leap for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, his motion had been four times swifter than it is ordinarily.</p>
                     <p>Now 'tis known by demonstration, that in one minute he ordinarily doth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98078:65"/>move 2500 <hi>Germane</hi> Leagues, and more, a wonderful swiftness and rapidity, such as our imagination can hardly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. One would never believe any thing could be added to so great swiftness, and nevertheless God had augmented it four times, yea, forty times, nay, it may be a hundred times as much, if <hi>Hezekia</hi> had desired it; a prodigious wonder.</p>

                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98078:73"/>continued but very few days in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive integrity. Yet the History doth not name neither the day nor the year of his fall, nor in what age it was.</p>
                     <p>And as the Scripture never expresseth the total sum of the years of the life of a wicked man, as many have observed, so it would not mark the time sin was born: Many sins committed since are there circumstanced, by the expression of the time when they hapned; but the first sin that produced all the others is there mentioned, without the least designation of the term of its birth.</p>
                     <p>All the conjecture which we can give thereof is this: The Scripture relating the Creation of the works of God, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished them from those that are not of his making, and yet nevertheless hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned soon after the Creation. Now this is one of the marks of that distinction, that of all the works of God, it is said on what day they began to be; but the day sin was born, is not marked in the Kalendar of the holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>Yea, long after the Creation, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture forbore to express the year wherein <hi>Cain</hi> killed his brother. That silence hath many causes, but we see but very few of them.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98078:76"/>night to slay 185000 men. One Angel alone was able in three days to cause 70000 men to die of the Pestilence. One Angel could exterminate all the first-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the space of one hour.

                     <p>OF some kinds of sins, the Law saith, That the person found guilty <hi>shall be cut off from his People,</hi> (as he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected Circumcision) or <hi>cut off from the Assembly of Israel,</hi> (as he who, during the time of the Passover, should have eaten any leven'd thing) and the like, touching many other breaches or omissions of the Ceremonial Ordinances. But the terms of that penal Law are diversly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Many Expositors do believe, that these words do signifie a banishment: But, 1 A man might be cut off from the Assembly, although he still abode in the Land of <hi>Israel;</hi> so the <hi>Bastard,</hi> the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, the Ammonite,</hi> could dwell in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and yet they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Assembly. 2 In all the History of the Old Testament, there is not one Example found of any <hi>Israelite,</hi> who was judicially banished from his Country for any offence whatsoever;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98078:83"/>There were other penalties, either more rigorous, or gentler, but not that of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. 3 Although he who had acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally killed a man, was commanded to leave his house, and the City of his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to retire himself into a place of refuge; yet he continued in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and even in some City of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and went not into any strange Country. 4 Although the Law-giver im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed temporal punishments on Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, yet he had a care of their souls, and would not expose them to the danger of becoming Idolaters. Now in what danger, as to that, would that man have been, who should have been obliged to live amongst Idolaters, far from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Exercises, and of the sacred Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which were enjoyed but in the Land of <hi>Israel.</hi>

Such as God sent into Foreign Countries, he preserved them from the contagion of the Idolaters by his special assistances, as

As for the faithful, who have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the general calamity, he hath provided them of Antidotes against the infections of Paganism, as <hi>Daniel</hi> and his Companions.

                     <head>The Pestilence which was in <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> touched no Woman, nor any Male under twenty years of age.</head>
                     <p>IT carried away 70000 men, as the History expresseth; we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that in the enumerations of persons, which are in many places of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, the name of <hi>Man</hi> is the name both of the Sex, and of the Age; of the Sex, to distinguish him from Women; and of the Age, to distinguish him from those
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98078:85"/>whom the holy Tongue calleth <hi>little ones,</hi> for so it calleth all those that are not yet of age to bear arms; and that age was prescrib'd, for in their Musters none were lifted for the War unless he was twenty years of age, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.23.</p>
                     <p>Now its easie to understand, why the Pestilence neither took away, nor touch'd, any woman, nor any male under twenty years of age. The numbring of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which <hi>David</hi> caused to be made, was to make him know how many fighting men he had, and consequently what were the forces of his Kingdom. Women therefore were not then numbred, nor those who were under twenty years of age. But as the action of <hi>David</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, so it had a punishment answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the offence; <hi>David</hi> thought to glorifie himself by the number of his fighting-men, and God lessen'd the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his fighting men, sending a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality amongst them. It reached not to any one whom either sex or age rendred uncapable of the War, and whom <hi>David</hi> had not numbred; but to those onely who had been the subject of his pride, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.9.</p>

Why then doth she prevent him in this Canticle? Certainly the Bridegroom had already spoken to the heart of his Spouse, before ever she opened her mouth, yea, and he dictated to her what she was to utter; the first words she pronounced, which are the first of this Canticle, are after to those the Bride-groom had spoken to her in her soul.

                     <head>Why God hath often punished Idolaters, who had plundred the Temple of the false gods, and hath given a reward to those who plundred and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>As for the second, 'tis known how <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> prospered, even after he had destroyed the Temple of God. This is very observable, that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> having taken the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> God did further recompence his pains, by conferring on him the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt, Ezek.</hi> 29.16, &amp;c. But how cometh it, that God doth interest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the violation of the Temples of the Idolaters? what hath his Justice to do with the nullity of false gods, that he should take their cause into his hand? To this we may answer, 1 Whosoever doth lift up himself against that which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be God, acteth against the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of his own conscience, which doth forbid him to attempt against the Deity. For although his blinded conscience makes him take imaginary Deities instead of his Creator, yet is it still a crime to make war against that, which the conscience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to fear and honor as a Deity. 2 Those who plundred their false gods,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98078:89"/>were not directly punished for such a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, but for other crimes, although sometimes that punishment came upon them in the very act, or in the place where they committed the sacrilege.</p>
                     <p>The other question, touching the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> doth seem more difficult to resolve; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture attesteth, that God gave them to him for a recompence: But must a publick Thief, the Scourge and Pest of Mankind, be rewarded with such a Salary?</p>
                     <p>We ought to observe, that the justice of God being willing to punish the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Nations about them, caused the Arrest thereof to be signifi'd to them, and made <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the Executioner. The Predictions are frequent in <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> declaring to them, that <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> should subdue them; but they believed them not. But God, who hath an interest in the honor of his Messengers, verifi'd their Prophesies, and particularly rouching the destruction of the Temple; for he shewed according to his Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was employ'd by him, and fought under his Banner to destroy the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Temple it self. It is then no wonder if God gave victories to him, who executed the Decrees of Heaven, although for his own advantages, as a mercenary servant.</p>

                     <p>A long time after, <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> the son and successor of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> was also condemned to lose his Kingdom: <hi>Daniel</hi> read and interpreted the sentence to him, but gave him not the advice he had given to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> for he spake not to him of amending his life to avoid his ruine.</p>
                     <p>We must know, that God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed a time for the repentance of sinners, as we have already seen; to some he

                  <p>THE <hi>Jews</hi> have many Principles, which at the first sight seem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but indeed they do make void the Authority of the New Testament; and he that lets them pass without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, doth insensibly renounce Christianity: They are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of their <hi>Rabbins,</hi> whose Traditions pass for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles amongst them: You shall but in vain alleage unto them either <hi>Moses</hi> or the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as long as the <hi>Jew</hi> gives them the <hi>Rabbins</hi> to be Collateral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, with an equal right of suffrage. Those men are greatly deceived, who in disputing with such Adversaries, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb facs="tcp:98078:112"/>that they must at first come directly to the Question concerning the <hi>Messias.</hi> On the contrary, we ought to begin by the overthrowing of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Traditions: Now they are destroyed if we let them see, that they consist of evident Blasphemies, gross Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, fabulous Tales, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Contradictions, and other Monsters, repugnant even to commonsense. I have shewed some scantlings of it in a short verbal Conference I had lately with one of the most famous <hi>Rabbins</hi> of this Age, and had he accepted of the continuation thereof, either by word of mouth, or by Writing, as was offered him by me, I am certain he should have had yet a thousand times worse success.</p>

                     <p>IF that be granted them, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the New Testament, which they undertake to cut down by the root. We read therein, that the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> having delivered a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to <hi>Zachary,</hi> the Father of <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> six months after he carried another to the <hi>Virgin;</hi> which could not be, if this Maxim of the <hi>Jews</hi> be true. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the same Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> had a long time before performed the office of a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98078:113"/>Messenger, being sent to <hi>Daniel.</hi> From whence it will follow, that after that time he never carried any Message, and, by consequence, never spake either to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> or the <hi>Virgin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But these blind <hi>Jews</hi> have not observed that; for even the same Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> under the Old Testament, carried two several Messages at several times, and to the same person, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 8 and 9. the first in the third year of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar,</hi> and the other in the first year of <hi>Darius;</hi> one of them touching the four Empires, and the other touching the death of Christ, the destruction of the second Temple, and the prefixion of the seventy weeks.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, What inconvenience would there arise, if one Angel be employed in two Messages? On the contrary, it was convenient, that the same Angel, who had already spoken unto men, should be sent again to them for a greater confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus, when <hi>Daniel</hi> was sorrowful, God sent him a message by the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel who had spoken to him heretofore, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.21. And as for <hi>Zachary</hi> and the <hi>Virgin,</hi> God sent them word by the same Angel who had marked the seventy weeks; from whence they might collect, that the time of the Redemption was drawing near. Was not the same Angel, who had
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98078:113"/>fore-told the measures of that time, the fittest to declare the fulfilling of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, when the term thereof was ready to expire. To the contrary it was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and it hath conduced to the strengthning of the faith of those who were waiting for the Redemption; that the same Messenger who had foretold the time, should come again towards the end of that time, to put them in mind of his Prediction, and to advertise them, that the accomplishment thereof was at hand. And in this especially we may see an effect of the wisdom of God.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, We might alleage to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that Angel who appeared twice to the wife of <hi>Manoah, Judg.</hi> 13.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for these were two several Voyages, and two several Messages, although both tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the same thing, and represented the same subject.</p>
                     <p>To be short, This Maxim of the <hi>Jews</hi> doth even contradict the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>THis assertion of the <hi>Jews</hi> is different from the former, but tendeth to the same end, which is, to give the lie to the New Testament in two fundamental Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> the Resurrection and the Ascension of our Lord. For we do read, that his Resurrection was joyntly declared by two Angels; and likewise as he ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaven, two Angels together, in the same time and place, did speak to the Apostles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.4, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 20.12, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 1.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now those Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would be false, if it were true, that two Angels were never sent together about one message.</p>
                     <p>But here again we may observe the blindness of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the midst of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98078:114"/>greatest Lights: Can they deny that two, nay, three Angels, were sent together to speak to <hi>Abraham?</hi> and though one of them was the chiefest, yet, did they not all speak unto him? <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.9. and though but one of them should have delivered the errand, did they not all three come upon the same Message touching the birth of <hi>Isaac?</hi> What then shall become of this Maxim of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which contradicteth so illustrious an Example of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament?</p>
                     <p>They ought also to have considered that which is very remarkable in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. When God hath employed two or many Angels, to deliver one and the same Message, his end was, that they should not onely be Messengers, but also Witnesses of the truth of his Words. For as amongst men, they do relie upon the Depositions of two or three Witnesses, so the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of two or three Angels hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the faith of those to whom they have spoken. This we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the <hi>Harmony of the Times.</hi>

                     <p>ALong time since their Ancestors have spoken in the same manner, saying, that the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> i. e. <hi>his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts, do never come down upon a Gentile;</hi> but this prejudice of theirs hath been found to be false: For with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have seen, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have received the miraculous gifts of the holy Ghost, even that of Tongues, which never any Prophet had under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had forewarned, that he would pour down his spirit upon <hi>all flesh, Joel</hi> 2.28. so far was he from promising for ever to confine his Spirit to their Nation, or make it hereditary to them onely, and to debar from it all other Nations.</p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:98078:115"/>
                     <p>Their Rabbins themselves are not all of the same opinion about this point, for one of the most famous amongst them, <hi>Rabbi David Kimchi,</hi> doth hold, that the Prophet <hi>Obadia</hi> was not of the Stock of <hi>Israel,</hi> but a Proselyte of <hi>Idumea:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he doth confess, that a man that was not born an <hi>Israelite</hi> could yet be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. If the <hi>Jews</hi> reply, that the <hi>Idumeans</hi> were <hi>Hebrews,</hi> descended from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> it will then follow, that the spirit of Prophesie was not peculiar to <hi>Israel,</hi> but communicable to other Nations. But by the word <hi>Hebrews</hi> they understand onely the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they might appropriate to themselves, though in vain, the faculty of becoming Prophets.</p>
                     <p>They ought rather to have considered, that <hi>Judaism</hi> had never any Prophets; for had ever any of them the spirit of Prophesie since they rejected Christ? On the contrary, <hi>Christiamsin,</hi> and the beginnings of it, have been animated by that spirit which hath authorized it, not onely by the gift of Prophesie, but also by that of healing, of working wonders; great works, the discerning of spirits, the diversity of Tongues, and the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. How comes it to pass, that the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie hath not assisted <hi>Judaism</hi> against the <hi>Christians,</hi> but hath supplyed the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98078:116"/>
                        <hi>Christians</hi> against <hi>Judaism?</hi> Or if they deny, that the spirit of Prophesie hath been on the first <hi>Christians,</hi> how comes it to pass, that that spirit never came down upon any <hi>Jew</hi> to oppose <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> opposed <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, <hi>Elija</hi> the false Prophets of <hi>Ahab; Micaiju, Zedakia,</hi> and <hi>Jeremia</hi> many Impostors, who bragg'd much of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations contrary to his own? If ever the <hi>Jews</hi> had need of the spirit of Prophesie, it was then when <hi>Christianity</hi> began to appear, and the destruction of the second Temple was drawing near; but that spirit was gone from them, and they never had it afterwards.</p>

                     <p>DIverse reasons have induced us to give a Note on this Maxim of the Rabbins. 1 The <hi>Jews</hi> on the same, do build others, which will follow in order. 2 They would give a lie to the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, where <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> are expresly called Prophets, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.30, 31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.15. 3 Their boldness is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, to take away the quality of a Prophet from those, whom they confess to have spoken by an extraordinary gift of the holy Ghost, and to have received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98078:117"/>from the mouth of Angels, and by Dreams and divine Visions. 4 They do speak in terms contradictory. 5 They shew how weak their reasoning is.</p>
                     <p>For first, as for <hi>David,</hi> What makes them say, that God never spake imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to him? <hi>David</hi> telleth us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the same Text, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord spake by me.</hi> 2 As for <hi>Daniel,</hi> is he not a Prophet to whom <hi>God hath made himself known in vision,</hi> or to whom <hi>he hath spoken in a dream? Numb.</hi> 12.6. doth not this description of a Prophet belong to <hi>Daniel?</hi> 3 This grand Rabbi and his followers fall into a contradiction; for in the same place he acknowledgeth him for a Prophet, who in a Dream seeth a Parable, and in the same Dream receiveth the Interpretation of it, as it hapned to <hi>Zachary;</hi> but the same hapned to <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 2.19. and all the seventh chapter along.</p>
                     <p>But they say, <hi>That yet, after <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he Dream, and the Interpretation of it, he doth still give it the name of a Dream, Dan.</hi> 2.19. <hi>and</hi> 7.1, 2, 15. <hi>and</hi> 8.27. What of that? Because <hi>Daniel</hi> relates that he hath had Dreams, wherein God gave him marvellous revelations, even making him to know the very thoughts of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> and the successions and forms of divers Empires; are not these Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98078:117"/>therefore Prophetical? Because, say they, he repeateth, that they hapned to him in a Dream. What a wild Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this to degrade a Prophet! is there any spark of judgment in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course?</p>
                     <p>Some will demand, Do they not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the <hi>Psalms</hi> and the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> have proceeded from the holy Ghost, and to be Canonical and true pieces of the Old Testament? They do indeed confess it, and give them the Title of <hi>Hagiographes,</hi> Why then not that of <hi>Prophetical?</hi> It is a <hi>Jewish</hi> Logomachy, or a frivolous distinction. But it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for us to mark it, because the <hi>Jews</hi> would make use of it against the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments we oppose to some other of their Maxims, as we shall see in its due place.</p>

                     <p>IF we should grant to them, that all the Apocalypse, which shutteth up the New Testament, and indeed all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, would be declared null: For it is said, that St. <hi>John</hi> received it being in exile, confined to a very small Island, where he was not Master of himself, but had his abode there as a Prisoner.</p>
                     <p>But who told them, that the Spirit of Prophesie is never found in a Captive, or in one who hath not the disposal of his own person? do they fear that the spirit it self should be prisoner if it were a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Was it not in a prison <hi>Joseph</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that which should come to pass to the two Officers of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> even to the naming of the very day? If that Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not Prophetical, how shall we then call it? Nay, it was in the prison where the Spirit of Prophesie began to come down on <hi>Joseph,</hi> who never had it before.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Daniel</hi> knew how to repeat and interpret the Dream of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:98078:118"/>it could not be but by the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, although the <hi>Jews,</hi> by a distinction full of vanity, which we have now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, dare say the contrary. But in what condition was <hi>Daniel</hi> then? In that of a prisoner, and such a one that was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.13, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, here is an Example not to be replyed against; <hi>Jeremy,</hi> to whom the <hi>Jews</hi> dispute not the quality of a Prophet; had he not Prophesies in the Prison, yea more then once? Let them but read that which is written, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 26, <hi>&amp;c. Jeremia was shut up in the Court of the Prison, &amp;c. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremia, saying, &amp;c.</hi> Let them also see the 33th. Chapter, <hi>The word of the Lord came to Jeremia the second time, while he was yet shut up in the Court of the prison, &amp;c.</hi> This word was a Prophesie of the re-establishment which was to come, contrary to all likelihood, after the ruine of the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the transportation of the people into <hi>Babylon:</hi> And their Masters the <hi>Rabbins</hi> do confess it to be a Prophesie. What a spirit then of madness is this, which makes them say, That a Prophesie never came unto a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner?</p>
                     <p>As for banishment, was not <hi>Ezekiel</hi> an Exile when he was in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon?</hi> and when he had such high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98078:119"/>and in so great a number, which the <hi>Jews</hi> confess to have been Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, was he not in Captivity?</p>
                     <p>We see then, that neither Banishment nor Captivity could hinder, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophesie should indite the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi> nor that the Angels should speak to the Apostles in the Prison, and deliver them out of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.18. and 12.7. nor yet that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> should cause an Earth-quake, and make the foundation of the Prison to shake, and loose all the Prisoners, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98078:119"/>Reasons; but we will add thereunto that which followeth.</p>
                     <p>The intention of the <hi>Jews</hi> is to prevent the Objection we make to them, <hi>viz.</hi> That so long since they had no Prophets; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in their bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> God did never leave them without Prophets, but for a little while. To which they answer, That a man who is persecuted, or a subject to other Nations, is incapable of the Spirit of Prophesie. And that being all of them in this dispersion, and persecuted, none of them can have the Spirit of Prophesie. That even if there were any Prophets among them, the Prophesie would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them, so soon as they should begin to be persecuted.</p>
                     <p>Upon this account, 'tis in the power of Persecutors to hinder the Spirit of God, to stop his influences, and to keep him from assisting, by his Revelations, those that are persecuted for his sake, even when they stand more in need of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                     <p>But that impiety is refuted by it self, and is condemned by the Examples we have already brought, specially by that of <hi>Jeremia,</hi> who was persecuted even to an Imprisonment, and yet still received new Prophesies.

                     <p>THat Maxim is very jolly, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the Sacred History. If by the holy Ghost they onely understand the gift of Prophesie, yet is it not so, that 'twas never conferr'd on any but such as were in mirth. What then? if a man be afflicted for his sins, he is incapable of the spirit of Prophesie, whilst he remains in so lawful a sorrow, so necessary and so pleasing to the Spirit of God? From thence a fine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination would follow, That there was one day every year, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations,</hi> whereon as the Prophetical Spirit never came down upon men; for it was a day of mourning, when all the <hi>Israelites</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:98078:121"/>were bound to afflict their souls, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.23, 31.</p>
                     <p>But the Prophetical Spirit is so far from flying from a man, because of his sorrows, that on the contrary, that same Spirit hath often made sad those upon whom it came down, and remained with them in the height of their sorrow; witness <hi>Jeremia,</hi> witness <hi>Ezekiel, chap.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>The Spirit lifting me up; and taking me away, I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is it not true, that <hi>Elija</hi> was sorrowful even to the wishing of death, when God immediately spake to him, which is the highest degree of Prophesie, and gave them the Predictions we have observed upon the foregoing Maxim? 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> should rather consider, that the Son of God weeping out of sorrow, foretold them what hapned to them forty years after, that the enemies of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should cast a trench about her, and that not one stone should remain upon another in that unhappy City? They themselves relate, that the <hi>Romans</hi> caused the Plough to pass over it, and that there remained no mark of a City. They should say to the contrary, that the most excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies hapned, and were indited in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Which we could prove by many other Examples.</p>

                     <p>THis Maxim follows the former, and is read in the same places we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted, and we bring it in to shew, how gross the ignorance or the inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that it is no wonder if they do so grosly mistake in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, less clear then this is.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Hypothesis we have already overthrown, they do build this assertion, that an old man, because of his peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness caused by age, and other natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispositions, cannot have the faculty of Prophesie, sith it requires a jovial and cheerful man.</p>
                     <p>But we could bring them <hi>Daniel,</hi> though they endeavour to blot out his name
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98078:122"/>from the Catalogue of the Prophets, who was not much less then ninety years old, when God gave him those admirable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations concerning the seventy weeks, the destruction of the second Temple, that of the Kingdom of the <hi>Persians,</hi> the end of the posterity of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the debates of the Kingdoms of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> the vicissitudes of their Successes, their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and persecutions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>That Chronology is out of dispute. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was an Adolescent or young man, when he was carried Captive into <hi>Babylon:</hi> he passed there the whole seventy years of the Captivity, and three years after, that was also the third year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he received the Prophesie that we read in the 10, 11, and 12 Chapters; let every one judge whether he was not an old man. We might also mention <hi>Isaias,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied above forty five years, and was not a child when he began to prophesie: <hi>Hosea</hi> and <hi>Jeremia,</hi> who prophesied al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as long; which may be gathered out of the number of years of several Kings under whom they prophesied.</p>
                     <p>But among all the Prophesies, that which <hi>Jacob</hi> had and pronounced upon his death-bed, is worthy admiration, <hi>Gen</hi> 49. It is known, that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided by <hi>Lot,</hi> 245 year after <hi>Jacob</hi>'s death; how comes it that the Lot of each
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98078:122"/>Tribe doth meet with the prediction of that Patriarch? How comes it that the quarters, the manners, the conditions, and the particular qualities of each Tribe, specially the Kingship of <hi>Juda,</hi> are so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly marked therein? How old then was <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he had that prophecy? he was 147 years old. Therefore the Prophetical Spirit was not inconsistent with the old age of a man.</p>
                     <p>We must here observe another Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction the <hi>Jews</hi> fall into: For that same <hi>Rabbine,</hi> whose words they do observe as so many <hi>Oracles,</hi> in that Book we have already so often alledged, doth write, that an old man, and he who is near unto death, are the fitter to conceive, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the things of God, than he that is yet young. How then can they affirm, that young folks are fitter for Prophecy? He that is less fit for apprehending the things of God, can he be the most capable of prophecy?</p>
                     <p>Finally, Among the spiritual gifts God had promised, he saith, <hi>Your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions, Joel</hi> 2.28. It is because for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the prophetical Revelations were often given, either in a Dream, or in a Vision, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6. God then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised such Revelations to old men; But the <hi>Rabbius</hi> will not believe him.</p>

                     <head>The Examination.</head>
                     <p>THis good <hi>Rabbine</hi> dares not openly say, that the Law is imperfect, but onely that it seems to be so. But if it falsly seems to him to be so, he ought to accuse his own imperfection, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the Law of God. But his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign (as well as of his Colleagues) is, to authorize the Opinions and the Traditions of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> as necessary supplements to what is wanting (as they pretend) in the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What are these wants? These are the chiefest they do alleage: When the Law speaks of the month of the year, it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not whether they be Solary or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; a distinction necessary, that the true time for the celebration of the Feasts may
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98078:123"/>be known, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. It mentioneth not what are those parts of the Beast, whose fat is prohibited, <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.17. It expresseth not the signes whereby they might discern the unclean Birds, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.13. It determines not the place where they should keep the Sabbath-day, whether in the House, or in the Court, or in the City, or in any other place of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29. It particularizes not the works which are lawful or unlawful on the Sabbath-day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. It mentioneth not whether the father may be the heir of his son, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. It forbids not the mariage of a man with the wife of his father, or with the mother of his mother.</p>
                     <p>These are the most remarkable points wherein they say the Law is defective. Now most of these things are Ceremonial, and their time is expired; and though it it were necessary to know all these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, we can shew, that there is not one of them which are not found in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of that Ceremonial Law.</p>
                     <p>But the two last points require two words of answer. On the first, This <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> a famous Writer, and antienter then the <hi>Talmud,</hi> saith, that <hi>Moses hath been silent of the succession of parents to their children, because such cases are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, by the course of Nature children rather succeeding their parents: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98078:124"/>it hath preserved the right of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; for indirectly it calls them to the same right it hath given to uncles. It giveth therefore the succession,</hi> 1 <hi>to the sons;</hi> 2 <hi>for want of them, to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> 3 <hi>to brothers;</hi> 4 <hi>to uncles on the fathers side. Wherein it appears, that a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may have a better right to be the heir of his own children.</hi> So saith <hi>Philo,</hi> in the Treatise of the Laws. By which it appears, that the antient <hi>Jews</hi> do contradict the modern <hi>Jews,</hi> for they did not believe the Law to be defective in this case.</p>
                     <p>As for the other, is it not most evident, that the same prohibition which forbids the son to marry his own mother, forbids him also to marry his grandmother? and if it was needful the Law should expresly name the grandmother, would it not have been likewise necessary it should name the great-grandmother, and all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesto<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s of a man to infinity? We had not then known, that the mariage of a man with his grandmother was unlawful, unless the <hi>Rabbins</hi> had told us so. They have taught us that which neither the Law of Nature, nor the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did ever teach. Where is the shame of those men!</p>
                     <p>But because they use such pretences to cover their enormities, when they say, the Law is defective, 'tis requisite we should know, that they contradict one another.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98078:124"/>For their famous <hi>Rabbine, Moses,</hi> in the Book vve have alleaged, saith in express terms, That <hi>the Law of Moses is perfect, and that there is nothing in it that's su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous or defective;</hi> and thereupon he brings the vvords of <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.8.

                     <p>HEre is Paganism in the Doctrine of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Heathens believe, that the Demons or Spirits having lived a long time, did at the last die one after another, and that yet their kind was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in other individuals succeeding the former, as amongst men and other living creatures.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98078:125"/>things unknown to all the Prophets: For first he tells us, that the Devils die; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless he tells us not, whether their death proceeds from sickness, or from age; nor how long a time they do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily live.

                        <hi>Hazle-nut;</hi> but I could never learn in what part of the body they place it, and I believe they themselves do not mark it; which nevertheless they ought to do, that a due regard might be had of so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Bone.</p>
                     <p>Much might be spoken on this Fable, we shall content our selves to mark it with two dashes of our Pen: 1 What Scripture, what Anatomy, what Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath told those <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that there is a bone in mans Body, which can never suffer corruption, or lose its natural form? 2 Grant it should be so; Doth the Resurrection of the whole body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on that bone? Suppose it be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally incorruptible, can that natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity produce the Resurrection of the whole body? Shall the Resurrection, which is so wonderful a work, be wrought by the vertue of a bone, as the production of a Plant is by the seminal vertue of the seed. 3 We must know, that many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the most learned of them, have a strange opinion about that subject; for they hold, that there shall be no Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but onely for pious men; yea, and that the soul of the wicked pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth as the souls of beasts; so writeth their famous <hi>Rabbi, David Kimchi,</hi> upon the First <hi>Psalm.</hi> But their main design is to contradict the New Testament, which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98078:128"/>teacheth, that the wicked shall also suffer after death. But if good men are to be raised by the vertue of a bone, which is in their body, have not the wicked such a bone also? why then shall they not also, by the vertue of it, be raised from the dead?</p>

                     <p>CErtainly another <hi>Rabbi</hi> hath told me formerly, not without sorrow, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are the most stupid Nation in the world; that they love ignorance, and onely mind Letters of Exchange, and other affairs of this present world; and in that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98078:128"/>respect they may boast to be wise and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous. But the wisdome whereof that passage speaketh, which is mentioned by the <hi>Rabbine</hi> in his Writings, is far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the other.</p>
                     <p>God saith unto them, That if they add nothing to his word, if they punctually observe it, <hi>It shall be their wisdom, and other Nations shall praise them.</hi> But have they fulfilled that condition? Have they not added to the Law of God? nay, have they not made it void by their Traditions? Do the orher people of the earth praise them for their wisdom, as having the best Religion of all?

                     <p>THey would say, that they ought not to compute the time to know when the <hi>Messias</hi> shall come: The meaning is, that having so long expected him, and measured all the ages, and almost all the moments, to find the day of his coming, and being so often deceived in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, they are resolved to reckon no longer. And this is the sense of that <hi>Maxim</hi> which is so common among them: Now it cannot subsist but on a false Hypothesis, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the time when Christ shall come.</p>
                     <p>This deserves to be examined. We know that God hath revealed the times of diverse other occurrences that have
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98078:129"/>napned at the prefixed times: He foretold how many years should pass from the time he spake to <hi>Noah,</hi> to the Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. How many years since <hi>Ishmael,</hi> the son of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> woman, persecuted <hi>Isaac,</hi> to the coming out of <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 15.13. How many years from the revolt of the ten Tribes, to the destruction of the first Temple, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.5, 8. How many years the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> should last, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. Did not the faithful under the Old Testament reckon those years unto the end of the term of terms? <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. And now the Spirit of God which hath forewarned on what year such and such an event should happen, hath it not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told what time Christ should come? Christ, who hath been the end and scope of the Prophecies, the hope of the Church, the joy of the Patriarchs; He to whom the Nations were to gather, and of whom they expected an everlasting Redemption; Should a prefixion of time, more necessary then all the former, have been omitted by the holy Ghost?</p>
                     <p>But the seventy weeks revealed to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and which he was enjoyned to be mindful of, do overthrow this Maxim of the <hi>Iews,</hi> what means soever they use to divert the sense of the Oracle.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, though the year of the death
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98078:130"/>of the <hi>Messiah</hi> should not have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, do we not see, that all the events that were to go before it have appeared long ago? and those which not long after were to follow it, as the destruction of the second Temple, the overthrow of the State of the <hi>Iews,</hi> their dispersion, which hath already continued so many Ages, do they not all make it apparent, that the days of the <hi>Messias</hi> are already expired? In that regard indeed, they have some reason to reckon it no longer.</p>

                     <p>THis hath already been contradicted and consuted by the Learned; yet is it of concernment to put those in mind of it, who see not the consequences of that Maxim, which would seem indifferent to them: If we suffer it to pass, we must also renounce all the New Testament, which
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98078:130"/>affirmeth, that our Lord was put to death by <hi>Pilate,</hi> who vvas under the Empire of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> above seventy years after the suppression of the Reign of the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> to whom <hi>Herod</hi> the Great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Moreover, if our Lord died when the <hi>Maccabees</hi> had the Kingship, that date would make void the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which, by virtue of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, were necessarily, either to go before, or accompany, the coming and the death of Christ, or presently after to follow it, as that which was to happen at the end of the seventy weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> after the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Law-giver were taken away from <hi>Juda.</hi> For if Christ died at that time the <hi>Jews</hi> do mention, it will follow, that he is not the Christ, because then he would have come and suffer'd long before the time marked by the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>But the Heathen Historians (to whom this matter was indifferent) do in express terms attest, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was put to death by <hi>Pilate</hi> the Procurator of <hi>Judea</hi> under the Emperor <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Those are the proper words of one of their most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Historians, <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> who at no hand loved Christianity, but speaks of it as of a contagious disease. I have one reason more, which sheweth the falsity of that calculation of the <hi>Jews:</hi> It is certain, that Jesus Christ died by the punishment
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98078:131"/>of the Cross, to which they used to nail the hands and feet of the condemned person. Now this kind of death was never practised by the <hi>Jews;</hi> for the Law, whereof they boasted to be great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers, ordained but four sorts of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal punishments, which they used accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diversity of crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading, 2 Strangling of the hanged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. 3 Stoning. 4 Burning. But Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying was not in use amongst them; and when practised, it was not by them, but by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised Dominion over the <hi>Jews.</hi> How can it be then, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified under the Reign of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> when that punishment was not practised at all in <hi>Judea,</hi> seeing the <hi>Jews</hi> had a free and entire jurisdiction, and the Law whereto they adhered, did not ordain the crucifying of any? And thus this <hi>Jewish</hi> invention doth vanish away.</p>

                     <p>ON this account, those who blaspheme against the Son of God, and die de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing him, shall be saved as well as those that die blessing of him; and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains going to heaven by two contrary ways, even by that which leadeth to hell. 2 Do the <hi>Jews</hi> believe that the Messias, whom they look for, shall offer himself in sacrifice for their sins? and if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that sacrifice, is there any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for them? 3 Do they believe that the Messias, whom they expect, shall be the same Person, and the same Man, who is already come once, and whose death they have procured? If they believe it, will they cause him to die again another time? If they believe him not (as indeed we know they do not) doth not the difference lie onely in a circumstance of time? Not onely they do not wait for the same Messias, the same Person, but are forging to themselves another quite contrary, who instead of dying for others, shall canse millions of men to die, and will fill the world with blood and slaughter. Do two Messias's so contrary differ onely in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance? 5 There are some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which are of the Essence of a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98078:133"/>matter of Faith. There have been some Hereticks who said, that the Resurrection of the dead was already past, and that consequently we are no more to expect it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. Could they be freed from blasphemy, in saying, that the difference was onely in a circumstance of time, the time past being put for the future? can common sense agree thereunto?</p>
                     <p>Let us in this place observe, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Prophets do sometimes express the time to come by that which is past, they never express the time past by the future. When they said, <hi>Ʋnto us a Child is born,</hi> they spoke of what was yet to come, as if it had already come, to intimate, that the Prediction was as certain, as if the effect had already appeared. But when they spake of a thing already past, they never represented it as a thing yet to come; for, to what purpose should they do it? The future comes to pass, but the time past never comes to be future again. The time goes forward but never backward. And such Prophesies as do represent the future are turned into History when they are fulfilled, but History never turns into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</p>

The correspondency of the six Periods with the six days of the Creation.</head>
                     <p>FROM the Creation to the Death of Christ we do reckon 3960 years, which are six times 660. And as the first <hi>Adam,</hi> the last work of the Creation, was framed on the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98078:134"/>sixth day, so the Second <hi>Adam</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd about the latter end of the sixth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of 660 years. Such are the measures and divisions of the Time which ran from the Creation to the accomplishment of our Redemption.</p>
                     <p>That which now presents it self is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be attentively considered. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God made any general and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous change, contrary to the order of any work of the Creation, every one of such changes hapned within some of the six Periods, answering to that of one of the six days, whereunto that change is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite. The Examples will clear this.</p>
                     <p>Four great changes have hapned in the world, one in Earth, two in Heaven, and one in the production of Man. On Earth, when it was wholly covered by the Flood. In Heaven, when the Sun staid, and since when it went back. In the production of Man, when a Virgin brought forth a Child. For although Christ alone hath had such a birth, yet ought he to be considered, not as a particular man, but as being the second <hi>Adam,</hi> opposite to the former, in several respects.</p>
                     <p>All other changes hapned in Nature, (as the division of the waters in the <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea,</hi> the going back of <hi>Jordan,</hi> the speaking of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass, and other wonders) were but particular ones. Likewise, we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98078:134"/>do not here reckon the other Miracles, as the rising of the dead; for death is not of the Creation, which alone we consider here.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as to the changes we here speak of, here are the times when they hapned, answering the days of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereunto they are opposite.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. On the third day of the Creation, God caused the waters that covered the whole earth to withdraw, and made the dry land appear. To the contrary, within the third Period of the years of the world, God covered the whole earth with waters by the Flood.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. On the fourth day of the Creation, God having made the Sun and the Moon, he ordained they should uncessantly run; but in the fourth Period he caused them to stop in their course.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. On the fifth day of the Creation, the Sun began to be seen; he had already lighted the whole preceding day, vvhich was the fourth; but there vvas then no eye, as yet, to see his light. The light is onely for such creatures as are endued vvith sight, <hi>viz.</hi> Animals having life and sense; but there vvere none such until the fifth day of the Creation. In the fifth Period of the years of the vvorld, about the latter end, God caused that great Luminary to go back. But vvhereas upon the fifth day
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98078:135"/>day of the Greation, the eyes of the living creatures began to see the Sun going from the East to the West, in the fifth Period they savv him going to the contrary, from the West to the East.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. On the sixth and last day of the Creation, the first <hi>Adam</hi> vvas made, earthly, and a living soul. In the sixth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, tovvards the latter end, the Second <hi>Adam</hi> vvas made, heavenly, and a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Let us reckon each of these Periods of 660 years, and vve shall see, that all these changes are included vvithin the times to vvhich vve have assign'd them.</p>
                     <p>The first Period endeth at the year of the vvorld 660.</p>
                     <p>The second Period begins presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and endeth at the year of the vvorld 1320. Within these tvvo first Periods God hath produced no general change in the vvorld.</p>
                     <p>The third Period hath been from the year 1320 to the year 1980. Within that interval falls the year of the Creation 1656, vvhere hapned the Flood.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Period hath been from the year 1980 to the year 2640. Within that Interval falls the year of the Creation 2555, vvhere hapned the miraculous Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the time of <hi>Joshua.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth Period vvas from the year
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98078:135"/>2640, to the year 3300. Five years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of this Period the Sun vvent back in the days of <hi>Hezekia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixth and last Period was from the year 3300, to the year 3960. About the latter end of that Period, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 3928, the Virgin brought forth a Child; and in the last year of that Period, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> expiated the sin of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in the year of the Creation 3960.</p>
                     <p>If the world was created in the Spring-time, as its very likely, this term of 3960 years falls to be expired in the same season. And these six Periods, as the six days of the Creation, were followed by Christ's eternal Rest, whose Sabbath is not limited by the Evening and the Morning, as that of the Creation.</p>

The word <hi>Enos,</hi> or rather <hi>Enosh,</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> signifies a sad or mournful man. Why that name was given to that Patriarch, is a question by it self. But however, the Aspiration set by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse at the beginning of that word, takes away the signification, and leaves it none at all. Whereas all the names of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Patriarchs are significant, and point at some passage of the History of their time, which we ought not to annihilate.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe days of Christ from his Birth to his death, were thirty two years and six months, the years that ran from the birth of <hi>David</hi> to the death of Christ were thirty two times thirty two years and six months. The proof is easie to any that knows never so little of Arithmetick. We put the birth of Christ about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal Equinox, of the year of the world 3928, and his death hapned about the Equinox of the Spring, in the year 3960, which makes thirty two years and a half. As to <hi>David,</hi> he was born in the year of the world 2920; from that year to that of the death of Christ, there were 1040 years. The 1040 years make 32 times 32 years and six months. I say, 32 times 32 years, and 32 times six months, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber multiplyed by it self. The years of Christ ending at his death, multiplyed by their own number, by going back, do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98078:138"/>therefore meet with that of the nativity of <hi>David.</hi> We know that the Prophets speaking of <hi>Christ,</hi> calls him often <hi>David</hi> in many respects; and it's observed, that the Reign of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was of thirty two years and six months.</p>

                     <p>That time of prolongation was granted to <hi>Hezekia,</hi> that he might see a son of his to be of age to reign; but then he had as yet no son: but in the interval of fifteen years he might not onely beget a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, but also see him of age to sway the Scepter; and that was the thing <hi>Hezekia</hi> desired to see afore his death.</p>
                     <p>Yet 'tis to be observed touching those fifteen years, that the two first passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hezekia</hi> had a son, he had him but at the third year: 'twas <hi>Manasseh,</hi> who was but twelve years old when his father <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekia</hi> ended the last fifteen year of his life. To exercise the faith of <hi>Hezekia,</hi> God kept him in suspence till the third
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98078:139"/>year; as, after he had granted him his life, he appointed him the third day to go up to the House of the Lord.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Hypothese or Supposition we do here employ, is not indeed to be found in the Sacred History, <hi>viz.</hi> That for the coming into the Temple there were fifteen stairs about it, to go up into it; yet we ought not to reject all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents that bear well framed Characters. The same Author who reckons those fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen stairs, thereto applies those fifteen Psalms, called <hi>Graduals,</hi> namely, the 120th. and the fourteen following, which were sung in going up to the Temple, one upon each stair.</p>
                     <p>Let this pass for a meer humane Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet it is very likely: And supposing it to be true, there will be found a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful analogy. God doth promise fifteen years of life to <hi>Hezekia,</hi> and for an earnest

                     <head>Why among the Ancestors of <hi>Christ,</hi> who had Brethren, he descended from the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rather then from the eldest.</head>
                     <p>WHy came he from <hi>Seth</hi> rather then from <hi>Abel,</hi> who preceded <hi>Seth?</hi> from <hi>Sem,</hi> rather then from his eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Japhet?</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> rather then from his brother <hi>Nahor?</hi> from <hi>Jacob,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then from <hi>Esau?</hi> from <hi>Juda,</hi> rather then from his three brethren born before him? from <hi>David,</hi> who was but the seventh son of <hi>Jesse?</hi> from <hi>Nathan, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's</hi> younger brother? from <hi>Rhesa, Zorobabel</hi>'s second son, rather then from <hi>Abiud</hi> the eldest? From that eldest son, <hi>Joseph,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s Husband, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended; but the <hi>Virgin,</hi> of whom Christ was born, descended from <hi>Rhesa,</hi> who was but the youngest brother.</p>
                     <p>An example may be produced to the contrary. Of the Twins that <hi>Juda</hi> had by <hi>Thamar, Pharez</hi> was the first that came out of their mother's womb, and Christ came from him; but the holy History re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearseth, that that birth was monstrous,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98078:140"/>the hand of <hi>Zarah</hi> appeared before the coming forth of his brother <hi>Pharez,</hi> which hapning contrary to nature, it could not naturally give him a primogeniture or eldership.</p>
                     <p>Now, why God, in bestowing that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor upon a family or kindred, to cause Christ to descend from them, hath chosen and preferred the youngest brethren, this one reason will suffice: It is known how much the Primogeniture hath ever been esteemed of, and what advantages and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges even the Law of <hi>Israel</hi> hath ever attributed thereunto. Yet sometimes, and by an order from Heaven, the rights that were ordinarily entailed upon the Primogeniture, have been transferred to the youngest; witness the example of <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> of whom it was said, that the eldest should serve the youngest. And as God intended to shew, that grace depends not on the age, so he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manifested, that the preheminency of Christ came not from any primogeniture of his Ancestors, seeing he descended from those that were but the youngest.</p>

                     <head>Of all such as <hi>Christ</hi> descended from, according to the flesh, 'tis not reported, that any of them died a violent death.</head>
                     <p>AMong the Ancestors of <hi>Christ,</hi> named by St. <hi>Matthew, chap.</hi> 1. there are many, from <hi>Solomon, inclusive,</hi> unto <hi>Jechonias, inclusivè,</hi> that cannot be accounted among <hi>Christ</hi>'s Progenitors, but are comprehended in his Genealogy, for the reasons alledged by the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But, as to these, who have been all Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> many of them died a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, <hi>Amazia, Joash, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Josia</hi> had such an end. But as to such as were <hi>Christ</hi>'s Progenitors, we do not read of any of them prevented by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death. Not any of those that were before <hi>David,</hi> who himself, although he many times had been in very bloody fights, yet he never received so much as a wound; nor his son <hi>Nathan,</hi> of whom <hi>Christ</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended; nor any of those that came from <hi>Nathan;</hi> nor <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and so down to <hi>Christ,</hi> in his Genealogy, set down in the third chapter of St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it cannot be objected, that some of them may very well have died a violent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98078:141"/>death, although the Scripture mentions it not. Is it likely, that if any of them had suffer'd Martyrdom, the Scripture would have suppressed the memory thereof, since they were the persons from whom came the grand Martyr <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> Moreover, there are some deeds really hapned, wherein the silence of the Scripture is significant, and carries along with it some mysterie, whichwe ought not to annihilate. However, the Spirit of God, in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Progenitors, names di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, whom the holy Scripture relates to have died a natural death, but mentions none to have undergone a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death.</p>
                     <p>It seems the same was reserved to him who closeth up the Sacred Genealogy, namely, <hi>Christ</hi> himself, to be alone he who should die a violent death, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could not have died. <hi>Isaac,</hi> one of his Ancestors, was ready to have his throat cut upon an Altar, but the sword touched him not, and his death was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, a long time after. The death of Christ, as that of <hi>Abel,</hi> the first man that died since the world began, ought to have been violent. But as the salvation of the world could proceed but from the violent death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and God from time to time shewed those who were to beget <hi>Christ,</hi> it was a thing of concernment, that none
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98078:142"/>of them should die a violent death, that none of them might be taken to be the <hi>Christ</hi> himself.</p>

                        <p>Is the beginning of the History of the New Testament. It must be observed, that here we consider the order of the times, and not the order of the Books of the Scriptures.

                        <p n="1">I. The History of the Old Testament ends at the Priestly Genealogy: and the History of the New Testament begins by a Priestly Genealogy, namely, that of <hi>Zacharias, John the Baptist</hi>'s father. We must again here observe the order of the times. Now according to that order, the last History of the Old Testament is that, which cometh down to the beginning of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire under <hi>Alexander.</hi> At that time lived <hi>Jaddua,</hi> who was the High-priest when <hi>Alexander</hi> came to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> That <hi>Jaddua</hi> is mentioned by <hi>Nehemia</hi> in the Genealogy of the Priests, which we read in the 12 <hi>chapter,</hi> from <hi>vers.</hi> 10. to <hi>vers.</hi> 23. It appeareth then, that that place of <hi>Nehemia</hi> is the last
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98078:143"/>piece of the History of the Old Testament, and that it endeth at the Genealogy of the Priests: so that its ending is like unto the beginning of the History of the New Testament, which is also by a Priestly Genealogy.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. A <hi>Zacharias</hi> was the last to whom the Angels appeared under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and a <hi>Zacharias</hi> was the first to whom the Angels appeared about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the New Testament: Of those two <hi>Zacharia's,</hi> the one was a Prophet, and the other a Priest.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The first word that came from Heaven about the beginning of the New Testament, was pronounced by an Angel; and that word of the New Testament was pronounced by an Angel, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.1. and 22.16.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. That first word, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the New Testament, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the Temple unto a Priest, about the hour of burning Incense. All these Circumstances, the Place, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Time, serving to the Ceremonial Law, served to the preparation of the entry of the New Testament, which is the end to which the Old Testament was relative. Upon the closing of the New Testament, then the Temple, the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and all its Perfumes, soon vanished away.</p>

This appearing of an Angel in the Temple, is the onely Apparition that ever hapned there; never an Angel was seen in the Temple before, and never an Angel was seen there after. Before that Apparition the Angels were not seen then but in figure, under the picture of the Cherubims. But as the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the true Temple, and the head of the Angels, drew near, God wrought a thing never hapned before, to cause an Angel personally to appear in the Temple.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. That Angel, who appeared in the Temple, is the same who had formerly foretold the ruine of the Temple, and the suppression of the Sacrifices, <hi>viz. Gabriel, Dan.</hi> 9.26, 27. The term is known, which was by him prefixed for their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their desolation was to happen soon after the death of <hi>Christ;</hi> and the <hi>Christ</hi> was to die at the end of the seventy weeks, which make 490 years, and began at that same time when the Angel gave that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Of these 490 years, 456 were expired when <hi>Gabriel</hi> spake to <hi>Zacharias:</hi> from whence it was easie to infer, that the ruine of the Temple was nigh; and so much the more, because that same Angel, who had foretold the same long before, was now come into the Temple, as the fore-runner of the destruction thereof. Such a circumstance was a warning to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98078:144"/>
                           <hi>Jews,</hi> that they should no longer look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Temple, but should prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the receiving of Christ, whose coming was drawing near.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The first Miracle mentioned in the History of the New Testament, offers it self at the same hour, and in the same place. A King <hi>Uzziah,</hi> who presumed to go into the Sanctuary, was smitten with Leprosie in the first Temple; and now a Priest being in the Sanctuary, is from God smitten in the second Temple. The first Miracle hapned about the entry of the New Testament, was wrought in the Temple; and the last Miracle hapned in the Temple was wrought about closing of the New Testament, when our Lord gave up the Ghost, as we shall say in its place.</p>

                     <head>Six months after the Birth of our Lord, a Writing was made between the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was finishing, and the New Testament, that was beginning.</head>
                     <p>SInce <hi>Malachy,</hi> there had not been any Writing inspir'd by God.

Upon the eighth day of the nativity of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> his father <hi>Zacharias</hi> did write dovvn his name; that Writing, vvhich onely contained the name of a Man, vvas yet of a very great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as having been indited by an Angel in the holy Place, and noting the fore-runner of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> That Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98078:146"/>might be styled the last of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and the first of the Nevv Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or indeed, it hath hapned betvveen both, and it seemed to signifie, that as the first Testament had been given in writing, so should also the second. The Pen of the Prophets having been staid for above 300 years, men might have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that henceforth no more writings indited by the holy Ghost, should be made.

                     <head>On the measure of the time of the abode of <hi>Christ</hi> on earth.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. THe total sum of the years <hi>Christ</hi> lived in this world, is never read in the Scripture, but is onely found therein in words. The whole number of the years of the Patriarchs, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is found in the holy History; the 930 of <hi>Adam,</hi> the 365 of <hi>Henoc,</hi> &amp;c. Why not also those of <hi>Christ?</hi> Because they have no end, and therefore cannot be numbred: We read indeed of part of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98078:146"/>his years, but who shall declare his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.8. The years of his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing on earth ought to be numbred together with those of his Residence in Heaven. This is particular to Christ, death hath not interrupted his Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. For other causes. The History of the New Testament never gives the whole sum of the years of any one. The daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> hath her age marked then when she died, but she was raised from the dead, and 'tis not recorded how long she lived after. Further, there are some very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient persons mentioned, as <hi>Zacharias, Elizabeth, Anne</hi> the Prophetess; but hovv long they lived in all, the History ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth not. The whole number of the years of the antient Fathers was observed, that it might serve to the Chronology that extended to the coming of Christ; the times included in that Chronology, were first reckoned by the Angels of the Fathers, and afterwards by the measures of other considerable Periods. But <hi>Christ</hi> being come, there was no necessity to learn how many years lived his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, or those that came after.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Although the Scriptures names not the whole sum of the time that ran from <hi>Christ</hi>'s birth to his death, yet 'tis lawful to enquire into it; yea, the holy History invites us thereunto, sith it doth mark the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98078:147"/>particular measures whereof the total of that sum consists; and very mysterious agreements are found therein, as we have seen in the enumeration of the years that ran from the birth of <hi>David,</hi> to the death of <hi>Christ.</hi> Here is another correspondence, which ought not to be neglected; from the revolting of the Ten Tribes under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> to the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and of the first Temple, 390 years passed. During that interval, the patience of God bore with the iniquities of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had order (<hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 6.) to represent that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by a Type of 390 days, during which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> should bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that of <hi>Judah:</hi> the number of the days answered that of the years. The number of the months that ran from Christs Nativity to his Death, is likewise the same; for thirty two years and a half that were between both make up 390 months. During all that while, <hi>Christ</hi> bore the iniquities of his people, till he expiated the same by his death; and bore, during those 390 months, not onely the iniquities of 390 years, but also the iniquities of 3900 years and above, reckoning from the time of sin's entrance into the world: Yea, and he bore the iniquities that happened since, and that will yet happen.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98078:148"/>that seems to annihilate and make void the same.

But how many more Examples or Divine Predictions have we, that seemed to be eluded by contrary events that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed them? So the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Christ</hi> having been foretold by an Angel, published by a multitude of those blessed Spirits, announced by a Star, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by the Wise-men of the East: Loe, <hi>Christ</hi> is in danger of death,

                     <p>Upon the tenth day of the first month the Lamb was set apart, and upon the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth it was killed. It was the term of five days.

                     <p>WE have seen that the first words God sent out towards the beginning of the New Testament, and the first words we read were uttered by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> were pronounced in the Temple: And now the first words he ever uttered touching his Death and his Resurrection, were likewise uttered in the Temple. Both the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have mutually interjoyned. The Temple, the place of the Sacrifices, hath
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98078:161"/>been the first place where Christ spoke of his death, which was to put an end to the Sacrifices, and to the whole Oeconomy of the Temple. Another circumstance is here to be observed.</p>

                     <p>THe Temple, whereof he was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was his own Body; <hi>In three days,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will raise it up;</hi> those three days expired just and exactly three years after that Prediction; for it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on the first Feast of the Passover, that followed the Baptism of <hi>Christ;</hi> since which Passover, to the fourth, when <hi>Christ</hi> died and rose the third day, there were precisely three years complete. On the first Passover of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Ministery, he began to foretel his Death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and on the last Passover he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished that Prophesie.</p>
                     <p>The three years that passed from one to the other, seem even to be included within the proper sense of the three days,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98078:161"/>that are marked for <hi>Christ</hi>'s Resurrection. Its known, that sometimes three days are taken for three years, (<hi>Amos</hi> 4.4.) and sometimes the number of certain years answers the number of certain days; for forty days, which the Spies spent in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> God ordered, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> should be forty years in the Wilderness, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34.) The proper and natural signification of the three days mentioned by <hi>Christ,</hi> hinders not, but that they may have a respect to the three years, which were immediately to precede or determine those three days: And so he hath not onely foretold how many days he should be in the condition of the dead, but also, though implicitely, how long time would be precisely from the time of that Prophesie, to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment thereof, the exact measure of three years.</p>

                     <head>A digression against certain Persons, saying, they have the virtue of healing a sick body by the meer touching of their hand.</head>
                     <p>I Would not vouchsafe to mention that Imposture, much less to refute it, had it not found belief, then also, even among the vulgar spirits. A Lord of very high ranck, who had chosen me to have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his conscience, being taken with a great and long sickness, forgot himself thus far, as to send, without my privity, for one of those wicked folks, called <hi>Stroakers.</hi> But that which hapned soon after was the death of that poor Lord, who yet had time enough to declare to me his fault, and ask God forgiveness thereof, as he did in my presence, shewing a great compunction for it.</p>
                     <p>Now, the bragging of these Impostors is grounded on that principle, whereunto many give faith; That the Seventh Son, whose birth is not preceded by the birth of any sister, hath that vertue to heal, by touching onely and stroaking with his hand. But who told them, that he that is but the seventh son hath that power, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98078:164"/>then the eldest of the seven? Again, the seventh son of a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Pagan,</hi> hath he also that faculty? <hi>David,</hi> who was the seventh son of <hi>Jesse,</hi> did he ever, in the disease of the first son he had of <hi>Bathshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> tryed to heal him by the stroaking of his hands? If they say, that <hi>David</hi> had two eldest sisters; had he not occasion to regret, that their birth had intercepted that rare privilege that was accruing to him? The holy History speaks of the seven sons of one <hi>Sceva,</hi> a <hi>Jewish</hi> Priest, who medled with exorcising, but not with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any sick persons of natural diseases; and at length the evil spirit did beat and wound them all, the seventh as well as the other, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. In a word, if birth could confer such a vertue, every seventh son would have naturally as much power, as to healings, as the Apostles had ever from heaven: Yea, and the gift of healing, which the Apostles had, was not in them as a permanent habit. But should any have it by his birth, 'twould be a perpetual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, residing in him as long as such a man should live. Away with such superstitions.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>CHrist</hi> never mentioned any causes of the diseases, but for sin, because they could not be taken away but by him. And yet although all diseases come from sin, <hi>Christ</hi> never expressed that cause but in matter of Palsey: To that man that was the first cured of it, he said, <hi>Thy sins be forgiven thee.</hi> To another, whose History we shall hear by and by, <hi>Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee;</hi> but he never spoke so to such as were afflicted with any other kind of diseases, as to them sick of the Fever, Dropsie, Hecticks, Leprous, Blind, or any way defective in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp;c. Yea, and when he was asked concerning the man that was born blind, whether that affliction came upon him for some sin of his own, or for the sins of his father or mother; His answer was, That there was no such cause.</p>

The Palsey that keeps him tyed, restrains many effects of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his soul; and if it happen that his body recovers its liberty, he ought vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to avoid the sin, which he was compelled before to refrain from.

(Josh.</hi> 1.1.)</p>
                     <p>But as two contrary events have often the prefixions of the like time, whereof we might give several examples, so 'tis here; after the thirty eight years the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> accomplished in the Wilderness, since God condemned them to die therein, their children had warning to prepare themselves to enter into <hi>Canaan.</hi> But to the contrary, after the thirty eight years that passed, since the healing of the sick of the Palsey, till the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> War, God gave the <hi>Jews</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and warned them, that they ought to prepare themselves to go out of <hi>Canaan;</hi> as indeed they did, being soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turned out of it, whereof the coming of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was a token to them.</p>

                     <head>An admirable dispensation of God, under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that after every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Martyrdom, there is always an example of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. A mysterious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that Rule.</head>
                     <p>IN the History of the New Testament, the examples of such as have been slain for the cause of God, therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended even the little Infants, from whom he hath drawn matter of glory, are thus ranked according to the order or the times. 1 The Infants murthered in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem.</hi> 2 <hi>John Baptist</hi> beheaded. 3 <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST,</hi> the grand Martyr, the faithful Witness, crucified. 4 St. <hi>Stephen</hi> stoned. 5 St. <hi>James,</hi> executed by the sword. 6 <hi>Antipas</hi> put to death for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Jesus, (Rev.</hi> 2.13.)</p>
                     <p>Now, this is worthy of admiration, that every one of these Martyrs was followed by the raising of one or many dead; after a Martyrdom there hapned a Resurrection; and again, after a Martyrdom another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and so always alternatively, though there hath been some interval of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98078:170"/>time, and other occurrences. So that since the Massacre of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom hath not followed the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out first the intervening of the raising of some dead. See then the order of them in this Catalogue.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. After the Martyrdom of the Infants of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> hapned, though a long time after, yet within that time there were no other Martyrs, there hapned, I say, the raising of the young man of <hi>Naim,</hi> and of <hi>Jairus</hi> his daughter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. After the Martyrdom of <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> hapned the Resurrection of <hi>Lazarus</hi> of <hi>Bethania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. After the Martyrdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> happened not onely his own Resurrection, which was singular to himself among all the Martyrs, but also the Resurrection of many Saints that were lying in the dust.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. After the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Resurrection of <hi>Tabitha, (Act.</hi> 9.)</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After the Martyrdom of St. <hi>James,</hi> the Resurrection of <hi>Eutych, (Act.</hi> 20.)</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But loe, here is a great and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exception; for the last of all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs mentioned in the New Testament, <hi>viz. Antipas,</hi> is not followed by any that hath been raised. That Martyr, the last of all, is different from all the former, in that after his death there is not any example found of Resurrection: Is it not to signifie,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98078:171"/>that there remains yet a Resurrection, to accomplish the Parallel of the Martyr, and of those that have been raised from the dead? It is the last Resurrection, when <hi>Antipas</hi> himself, and all the other Martyrs not yet raised; yea, and all the Saints shall be rais'd in glory.</p>

                     <p>AS they were carrying the young man of <hi>Naim</hi> to bury him, none, no not his own mother, thought on imploring the mercy of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that he might be pleased to raise that dead; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> brought him to life again: But the daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> was raised at the intreaty of her father. It is to be observed, that before the young man of <hi>Naim, Jesus Christ</hi> had never raised any dead. He had made himself known by several Cures, and other Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but not yet by any of that kind: His power had appeared on the living, but had not as yet extended it self to the dead. Therefore no addresses were made to him, for craving of him a miracle he had not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98078:173"/>as yet wrought. 'Twas then necessary, that the first time he wrought such a miracle, his goodness should prevent all petitioning. But having raised that dead, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to raise another, namely, the daughter of <hi>Jairus, (Matth.</hi> 9.18.) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had thereby encouraged the father.

The sense of this is, That among the proceedings or formalities the Servants of God used in working of their miracles, the highest of them is this we now mention, <hi>viz.</hi> when they have commanded that the Miracle should happen. For the command, when followed by the effect, shewed a special authority given them from heaven, and put them in a more eminent degree, then when they onely acted by prayer, or by touching, or by any other signes, or by fore-telling onely the Miracle that was to follow. <hi>Christ</hi> hath rebuked Agues, Devils, and the Elements: <hi>What manner of man is this, that even the Winds and the Sea obey him?</hi> Let us say more, <hi>Who is this man, that even the dead obey him? Elijah,</hi> and his Successor <hi>Elisha,</hi> being about to work Miracles of that nature, proceeded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by way of request to God, and by long formalities reiterated in several intervals:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98078:174"/>but they spake not to those dead they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to raise, much less did they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to return to life. <hi>Christ</hi> is the first who hath spoken to the dead, in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative terms, <hi>Young man, arise;</hi> and, <hi>Tabitha eumi;</hi> and, <hi>Lazarus, come forth.</hi> After <hi>Christ,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> used also the word of command towards one dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.40. but that Apostle spoken then but as a Messenger, bringing the command which the Son of God was sending to that dead.</p>

                     <p>AMong all the persons raised from the dead, she alone hath the number of her years recorded in the History; I mean, the number of years she had when she returned from the dead, which is not reported of any other. Now me-thinks this may be the reason of that singularity, the daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> was the youngest of all the persons raised under the New Testament; all the rest, the young man of <hi>Naim, Eutychus, Lazarus,</hi> and yet more then any, <hi>Tabitha,</hi> were more stricken in years. We have seen, that neither <hi>Christ</hi> nor his <hi>Apostles</hi> have raised any little Infants. For the reasons given then by us for it, it may be added, That under the New Testament, God hath not been pleased to work that Miracle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, but upon persons already of some discretion, who might have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent memory. of their return from among the dead. Whereas Infancy cannot judge of the greatness of such a wonder, nor keep it in memory, the impression of it being but weak in that young age, and subject to be soon blotted out. But the daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> was come out of her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98078:176"/>Infancy, though but a little while before; and because she was the youngest of all those that were raised under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the number of her years is marked therein, to let us know, that she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready able to consider the greatness of the Miracle wrought upon her, and to keep the memory of it, and therefore capable to bear witness of that wonder; which was the intention of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

                     <p>'TWas indeed because he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd the work of his Calling. But there is here a secret which is rectifi'd by the History. From <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s death, <hi>Christ</hi> remained the onely Prophet on earth. 'Twas necessary that the latter part of his Ministery, whereof remained about the space of a year and a half, should be accomplish'd, without the being of any other Prophet but himself. God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation is here to be consider'd; at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times there have been many Prophets in the world, at other times none, and then but one onely; such was <hi>Noah,</hi> a while after the Flood; such was <hi>Moses,</hi> at the coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> And this made a man so much the more illustrious, that he was the onely Prophet upon earth. It was therefore convenient, that the Prince of the Prophets should have a time, when
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98078:177"/>there should be no other Prophet besides himself. But a good part of the time of his Ministery was already gone, when <hi>John Baptist,</hi> though a prisoner, yet lived.

                     <head>Why the Son of God going to his Disciples that were on the Sea, made not a way to himself through the waters, but walked upon them.</head>
                     <p>THe waters had given way to the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the <hi>Red-sea,</hi> and since when <hi>Jordan</hi> divided it self, to let them enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Joshua;</hi> and since to <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he went over that River to ascend into Heaven; and again to <hi>Elisha,</hi> when he returned from <hi>Elija.</hi> So that kind of Miracle, of dividing the waters, had happened four times. But the Son of God was pleased to work an unknown Miracle on that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and unheard of till then, to be carried over the waters, and be born of them, either by rendring them solid, or any other way capable of bearing a man's body, or else being upheld onely by his own power: 'Twas a miracle altogether new, which he chose rather to work, then to reiterate a Miracle which already had happened several times, <hi>viz.</hi> the division of the waters. But this affords us the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of inserting here the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>

                     <head>CONSIDERATIONS.</head>
                     <head>Why <hi>Christ,</hi> who raised seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dead, healed but one deaf man? And why he used more formalities, and imployed more time in giving hearing to that deaf man, then in giving life to the dead.</head>
                     <p>IF the greatest Miracles had been always the less frequent, some might have imagin'd, that it had been harder for God to work them, then the production of lesser Wonders; as if his power had been subject to the proportion he gives to his works. But to shew, that the greatest Wonders are equally easie to him, he gave more examples of them, in some kinds of Miracles then of others, that were much lesser. To raise a dead man is a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98078:180"/>greater Miracle, then to give hearing to many deaf men; and yet the Son of God, who raised many dead, during the time of his Ministery, gave hearing but to one deaf, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.32, &amp;c. Let us yet add this: To raise a dead man is a greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, then to cure a sick man, though a dying. But of all the sick the Son of God healed, we find but one that was near death, <hi>viz.</hi> the Centurion's servant; but many that were dead indeed were raised by <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That deaf man, whom the order of the times causes us to represent here, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides an impediment in his tongue; yet that recovery of his hearing and speech, though the wonder of it was great, was less nevertheless then the raising of a dead man. And yet for the healing of that man, the Son of God employed more formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, much longer, and more various, then ever he did to any of all the dead he raised: He takes this Patient, he draws him aside, he puts his finger into his ears, he toucheth his tongue, applies his spittle to him; he looks up to heaven, he fighes, he says to him, <hi>Be opened:</hi> He never used so many things to raise a dead person; one word onely, <hi>Arise,</hi> was presently followed by the effect. By this he was pleased to shew, that the signes or ceremonies used by him, were arbitrary, and that his power
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98078:181"/>was not included therein, sith he used less in the working of his greatest Miracles, and more to the less.</p>
                     <p>The second wonder wherein <hi>Christ</hi> used much formality, was, when he gave fight to the blind mentioned in St. <hi>Mark, chap.</hi> 8.22, &amp;c. That Miracle followed the former.</p>

                     <head>Some kinds of Miracles <hi>Christ</hi> reserved to himself, during the time of his Ministery.</head>
                     <p>WHilst he was on the earth, no other ever gave sight to any blind, and no other raised the dead. He gave power to his Disciples, first to the twelve, and then to the seventy, to cast out Devils, and to heal all sorts of diseases and infirmities: but their commission reached not to the giving of sight to the blind, much less to give life to the dead. At least, we read not, that being yet in this world, his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had ever done any Miracle of either of those two kinds. <hi>Christ</hi> reserved some, chiefly those two, that are of the greatest, that there might be some marks of his Prerogative, that might put distinction between the Master of Miracles, and those
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98078:181"/>that acted onely by vertue of his orders. There are yet some other Miracles which never were wrought, neither before the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor since his Ascension, but onely by himself, immediately; whereof hereafter we shall see some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>

                     <head>Whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>LEt me have leave to bring on these words a new Exposition, or at least a Conjecture: This binding and loosing hath no relation to the persons, as if they were to be bound or loosed; nor to the things, as if <hi>to bind</hi> should signifie <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit;</hi> and <hi>to loose,</hi> should be the same <hi>to permit,</hi> which is the Exposition of a learned modern Author. But the next foregoing vvords in this Text, <hi>I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> do give some light to these. It hath been observed, that among the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties used by the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the creating of a Doctor of the Lavv, some keys vvere put into his hands; namely, the keys of the Archives or places vvhere the Copies
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98078:182"/>of the Sacred Books vvere kept; and 'tvvas as much as to say, that the nevv Doctor had povver henceforth publickly to read and teach. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> makes an allusion on that Ceremony, promising St. <hi>Peter</hi> to make him a Doctor of the Gospel. This hath been observed by our Predecessors, but vve may add thereunto vvhat follovveth.</p>
                     <p>It's knovvn vvhat the form of Books of old vvas, they vvere made after the manner of Rolls, and necessarily tied vvith some small string, to avoid the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiling of the Margents, and keep them in a good condition; vvhen any one vvas vvilling to read therein, they used to untie them; and vvhen a long intermission of reading vvas intended, they vvould again tie them. Novv the Keys promised by <hi>Christ</hi> to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> vvere the Keys that opens the dore to the Doctors of the Gospel, that they might take out of it the Book, and might tie and untie it; that is to fay, that they might keep it shut, or open it, as it shall be convenient. The first is done vvhen they do refuse unbelievers and unrepenting persons the application of the Promises contained in the Gospel. The second is done upon a contrary subject. An example of the first in St. <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, vvhen he said to <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician, <hi>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98078:182"/>matter, viz.</hi> in the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. Then was that Book tyed, as to that Hypocrite. That which is tyed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed, is indeed but one and the same Book, but distinguished from it self by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of those two actions. That which is savour of life unto some, and savour of death to others, is but one and the same Gospel.</p>

                     <p>That Assembly was the Epitome of the universal Church, considered in divers conditions, and at several times.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The three Apostles, that were yet subject to persecutions, and to death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Church, as 'tis yet Militant.</p>

                     <p>The bodies of those two great Prophets had formerly been miraculously taken out of the sight of men, and miraculously they then appeared again. That of <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken up into Heaven; men looked for it a while, but in vain, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.15, &amp;c. <hi>Moses</hi> his body was never seen dead, for God took it out of the sight of men, and with his own hands put him into a grave, unknown to this very day.

                     <p>'TWas needful to have one from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and one from the Grave, as we said just now. But in heaven, there were but two men in body and soul, <hi>viz.

Of those two that were corporally in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, God sent down him that had lived the nearest to the days of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to whom the fore-goers of <hi>Christ, John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> had the more likeness. Moreover, 'twas a common prejudice among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>Elijah</hi> was to come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before the <hi>Messiah</hi> should appear. But <hi>Elijah,</hi> that same Prophet, whom they thought would personally come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Christ,</hi> came then to witness, that <hi>Christ</hi> was already come.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98078:185"/>own hands; from whence it followed, that he could not be transferred nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his grave, but by the same hand that had shut him in there, and had even concealed the place; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to sight again, it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for some great action, whereunto God had reserved him. But as it was to give testimony unto <hi>Christ, Christ</hi>'s dignity hath so much the more appeared therein.</p>

So <hi>Christ</hi> himself, after he had seen the heavens opened; after the holy Ghost was come down upon him in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible form; and after, by the very voice of the Father, he was proclaimed the Son of God; presently after the same Spirit leads him into a frightful Wilderness, where he remains forty days without food, and with the onely company of wild Beasts; and also afterwards Satan doth present himself unto him, and carries him to high and dangerous places.

                     <head>Why the Son of God refusing his Disciples to command fire to come down from Heaven on the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> gives them a reason of it, which seemeth to be contradicted by

                     </head>
                     <p>THe reason of that refusal was, that the Son of man was not come to destroy mens lives: for, from thence he infers, that he ought not to suffer his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to cause the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to die. But when St. <hi>Peter</hi> caused <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to die, which happened since, was it not by the permission, yea, and by the commission of the Son of God, and by vertue of the power of working Miracles, he gave to that Apostle? But did not the same reason, for which he would not cause the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to die, avail likewise for <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we must distinguish the times. Whilst <hi>Christ</hi> was on earth, conversing among mortal men, he would work no other acts but of mercy towards them, causing those that were a dying to live, and such as were already dead to live again. But after his Ascension into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 'twas necessary he should likewise work some acts of justice, to shew, that he is at the right hand of God, and that one day he will judge the secrets of men, as he then judged the plot of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> On earth he practised but mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98078:190"/>since he is in heaven, he hath shewed a pattern of his justice.</p>
                     <p>'Twill therefore be necessary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand here, Why God suffered Satan to cause fire to fall down from heaven on <hi>Job</hi>'s servants, and yet would not permit the Apostles should cause fire to come down from heaven upon those infamous <hi>Samaritans.</hi>

                     <p>SOme days afore our Lord wrought those two wonders, he occasionally spoke of eighteen men on whom the Tower in <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, and slew them. And
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98078:192"/>soon after, being to give sight to a man, who was born blind, he sent him to the Pool of <hi>Siloam,</hi> that the same place that had been fatal to those men, might be happy to this man.</p>
                     <p>The other Miracle, the healing of the crooked woman, went before this, and followed nearer the discourse <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> had made touching the eighteen men, whom the Tower in <hi>Siloam</hi> slew. The eighteen years of the infirmity of that woman, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13.11.) do they not bear some analogy, tending to make it a memorial of that wonderful cure, of an inveterate disease of so many years as there were men slain, whom <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> had a little before remembred?</p>
                     <p>These circumstances happened not by chance: and the circumstances the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists have recorded thereof, can by no means be thought to be idle; the places, the times, the persons have therein such relations, as ought to be considered of.

                     <p>THat blind man was poor, yea, and a beggar, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.8.) Another blind

Would it not have been a double beneficence, if when he gave them sight, he should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have afforded them wherewith to satisfie their hunger? But as the best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the most subject to detraction, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> could have wanted no adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, who would have disputed the truth of the Miracle, saying, That it may be those beggars were never blind, but onely seigned to have been so, being hired with money: And indeed, as to him that was born blind, the <hi>Jews</hi> would not believe he had been so, till they were convinced it was so, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.18, &amp;c.) To prevent their blasphemies, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> abstained from bestowing any alms on those beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars.

                     <p>THe first dead man that was raised, was the son of a poor widow of <hi>Sareptha,</hi> and the second was the son of the rich <hi>Shunamite,</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.8.) The first raised by <hi>Christ</hi> was the son of a certain Widow, whose quality is not named in the History; and the second raised by <hi>Christ</hi> was son to one, who was the head of the Synagogue, and therefore illustrious among his fellow-Citizens, called <hi>Jairus.</hi> The first raised since the Ascension of <hi>Christ</hi> was the good <hi>Tabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> rich in alms she gave: And the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and last that was raised since the Ascension of <hi>Christ,</hi> was a young man who hath no other Epithet, but remains without a title, as having none that were considerable in the world.</p>
                     <p>Among several sick folks healed by <hi>Christ</hi> or his Apostles, we find the son of a Lord belonging to the Court, the servant
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98078:194"/>of a Centurion, and the chiefest man of an Island, (<hi>Act.</hi> 28.7.) Among those that honoured <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> living and dead, we find <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> one of the chiefest of his Nation, and the rich and honorable <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The wisdom of God was pleased, that among those who have given testimony to <hi>Christ,</hi> there should be some of the rich and highly qualifi'd ones, that their testimony should even be above all sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of corruption or of complacency.</p>

                     <p>IN several Orthodox Churches, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is yet retained to read publickly certain pieces of the Scripture once year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, each of them having a certain day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end. So the words of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> contained in the tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of St. <hi>John, I am the good Shepherd, &amp;c.</hi> were read upon the second Sabbath day that follows that which is called <hi>Easter;</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98078:195"/>therefore the reading of that passage is made in the Spring, and very seasonably, as a learned Divine of ours hath written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, saith he, it is the season whereat the Shepherds and their Flocks do begin to take the field.</p>
                     <p>But it should be observed, that those words of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> were uttered in Winter time, above three months before the coming of the Spring, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 10.22.) so that that <hi>Simile</hi> was not taken by the circumstance of the time of the year. We know that every place of Scripture may be read at any time whatsoever; yet it ought to be done with prudence, chiefly in publick Exercises. And particularly it is important for us to observe the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, wherein <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> spoke or acted; otherwise, we can have but a very dark and confused knowledge of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Gospel, and subject to several inconveniences.</p>

                     <head>The second time the <hi>Jews</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to stone <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the Temple, <hi>(Joh. 10.31.)</hi> A question on that subject.</head>
                     <p>WE read of our Lord, that two several times he expelled from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98078:195"/>the Merchants, one about the time of the first Passover within his Ministery; and the other time, about the fourth and the last: The first time he onely rebuked them for making the Temple a Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.) but the other time he charged them with a crime of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which was more enormous, namely, to have made the Temple a Den of thieves. The reason of this, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, may be this:</p>
                     <p>The first time our Lord expelled these Merchants, none had, as yet, attempted to stone him in the Temple, therefore he onely termed it then a market-place: but since they had endeavoured to spill therein the blood of the righteous, that place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be called a Den of Thieves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.13. For it seems, that our Lord pointed onely at their selling and buying practised in the Temple, yet to name that Theft and Robbery, would be a great Hyperbole, should not the term imply a more enormous crime then that of trading; I say, a crime, called by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name, and already committed by the <hi>Jews:</hi> for they had truly committed an act of true Robbers in the Temple, even when they endeavoured to murther therein <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> even twice. And it often happened, that God visiting the lesser ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, expressed not the same in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98078:196"/>censure, but onely remembred the greater, whereof the others are but the additions. Therefore here our Lord intended to say to them, You profane this Temple by the trading you practise therein: But was it not sufficient for you to have polluted it with murder, when you went about to stone me therein?</p>

                     <head>Why the Son of God stayed four days before he raised <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> from the dead?</head>
                     <p>AMong the reasons of that delay, this is very considerable; <hi>Christ</hi> was nigh his death; but he had promised to rise the third day, and that was incredible, it being without an example; for it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happened, that a body, dead three days before, had returned to life.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98078:199"/>of the dead, when God caused them to live again. Not the son of the widow of <hi>Sareptha,</hi> who was raised few hours after he yielded up the ghost; not the son of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> between whose death and resurrection there past not a whole day; not the daughter of <hi>Jairus,</hi> lately expired when the Son of God raised her; not the young man of <hi>Naim,</hi> whom they were going to bury; nor yet he who was thrown into the Sepulchre of <hi>Elijah.</hi> For it was not the custom of <hi>Israel</hi> to keep dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies long unburied, unless they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed; and the heat of the Climate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them presently, specially if they were kept above three days. But as to the young man of <hi>Naim,</hi> and him whom they threw into the Sepulchre of <hi>Elisha,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the condition, which seems to have been but very mean, nor the silence of the History, will not suffer us to say, they were embalmed, no more then <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whose corpse stunck after the fourth day.

                     <p>In a word, <hi>Christ</hi> having foretold, that

                     <p>SEveral causes are alledged of the tears <hi>Christ</hi> shed upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> his grave; but if it was for the death of a man whom he loved, why did he not weep for the death of such a friend, yea, of such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who died for the truth, <hi>viz. John Baptist?</hi> If it was in general for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of mankind, which death swallows down every day; whence is it, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> wept not for the two other dead he had raised before? If he wept, because <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was returning to the miseries inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this life; had he not the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at the resurrection of the others? If he wept out of compassion towards those, who were taking on for the death of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> why did he not weep, when he saw
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98078:200"/>a poor widow, a mother, lamenting for the death of her onely son, the young man of <hi>Naim,</hi> whom she accompanied to the grave?</p>
                     <p>It's very certain, that <hi>Christ</hi> had a great tenderness for us, but he hath kept in his tears to the drawing near of his last suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Therein, as well as in most of his actions, several degrees are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, near one to the other, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular this: Before he did sweat blood, which happened the day before his death, he expressed his sorrowfulness by a much less violent demonstration, <hi>viz.</hi> by weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Lazarus</hi> and on <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> It was convenient he should shed tears, before he should shed his blood; there was but a few days difference between both. For we do not read that he ever wept before. Although his whole life was a continual series of sorrows, yet they encreased more and more, as his death was drawing nearer and nearer; and at last they united and centred altogether, caused the tears to gush out, which he had still refrained dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his former sufferings. In a word, he was nearer to his last and more extreme sufferings, when he went towards <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Sepulchre, then when he heard of <hi>John Baptist's</hi> death.</p>

According to that account, that's known to be the antientest, the Passover which our Lord celebrated, his agony in the Garden, his death, and the circumstances thereof, happened all within one and the same day.

                        <p>The Question is the Answer it self. The nearer the Ceremouies of the Temple came to their end, the more religiously were they to be observed. For the death of <hi>Christ</hi> being represented by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, 'twas necessary that those Types should be handled and proposed with all reverence and holiness; but above all, when they came nearer to that perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the death of <hi>Christ;</hi> then were they the more holily to be displayed in the presence of their Prototype.</p>

                        <p>THe Evangelist St. <hi>Mark, chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. having said, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> found but leaves on that Fig-tree, addeth these words, <hi>For the time of Figs was not yet.</hi> But some learned men read otherwise, For the time of Figs was then: But the reason why they go from the common reading, and substitute other terms formally contradictory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is, say they, because at that season of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Feast of the Passover, Figs were already ripe in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,</hi> considering the heat of that Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98078:203"/>and that also Harvest then began.</p>
                        <p>But these men have either forgotten, or were ignorant, of the diverse kinds of that Fruit, growing at very different sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the year. For in Countries much less Southerly then <hi>Judea,</hi> there are some Fig-trees, whereof the Fruit is ripe before the Summer's Solstice, and others that bear ripe fruit but four months after; so that some do already afford nourishment to men, when the others have not yet put forth their buds. Who doubteth, but that the same may be in <hi>Judea?</hi> So, what is objected, that in the Spring there were some ripe Figs, cannot be said but of some kinds of that fruit, and of the latter sort of them, of which 'tis said, that the time of Figs was not yet. Therefore <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> met with some of those Fig-trees, the time whereof was not yet come to bear. And thus ought this to be limited, when it is said, that the time of Figs was not yet come; <hi>viz.</hi> of those Figs of that kind of Fig-tree, where <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> looked for some fruit. For in general, the Figs have more then one season.</p>
                        <p>It's observable, that those that put on an Affirmative in this Text, saying, 'Twas the time of Figs, make the Evangelist speak without reason; after he hath said, that <hi>Christ</hi> being come to the Fig-tree found there nothing but leaves, adds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98078:204"/>after, <hi>For the time of Figs was not yet;</hi> and this shews the reason why <hi>Jesus</hi> found there no fruit. But if you read, as those Interpreters do, He found there nothing but leaves, because it was the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Figs, What reason was that? There were but leaves, because 'twas the time of Figs; there was no fruit, because it was the time of fruit. Hath such a reading any sense at all?</p>
                        <p>Such as endeavour to introduce that Exposition, do but change one word in the Text, yea, and onely a word of one sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Greek Original; for instead of one <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> that is negative, and the consequence thereof is, that it was not the time of Figs, they put an <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> whose consequence bears a quite contrary sense: But such a change is against all the antient Copies, without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yea, contrary to reason.</p>
                        <p>Some other Expositors endeavoured to save the truth of the Text, by a means that's neither necessary nor secure; for in stead of the time of Figs, they read, The <hi>year</hi> of Figs, which is a very much forced Exposition, and is alledged without proof. What we have distinguished touching the divers kinds, and the different seasons of that fruit, is a certain thing, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on experience.</p>

                        <p>THose words are not inconsistent.

                        <p>That representation was made first by the slaying of Lambs and other Victims, used under the Old Testament; but though they represented <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death, yet they did not represent properly his Person.</p>
                        <p>In the interval of their time, <hi>Christ</hi> was represented by a man, <hi>Isaac,</hi> who was offered in Sacrifice, and in a manner recovered, as if he should have been raised from the dead; but he died not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: So that he rather represented <hi>Christ</hi>'s Person then his Death.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Bread in the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the breaking of it, do also less resemble <hi>Christ</hi> and his death, then such other Figures as preceded that Sacrament: For, is not a bit of bread broken, further off from the resemblance of man's body slain, then were the bodies of sacrificed Beasts? In these therefore was seen a bloodshed, yet it was not the blood of a man. In <hi>Isaac,</hi> a man is seen offered, but no blood shed; and in the Lord's Supper, we neither see a man's body nor blood shed.</p>
                        <p>Now this we may say on that subject, Before the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> it was m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98078:210"/>needful to have it drawn and represented by Figures, that should come nearer to the outward appearance; for such Draughts and Pictures supplyed the want of the History that was not yet. But since we have the History of the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that therein he is crucifi'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, the Sacraments being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to such a Picture, do rather tend to a remembrance in us of the spiritual vertue of that death, then to a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of all the visible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances therein: And so doth indeed the Lord's Supper suppose all those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; but that which is thereby formally represented, is the body and the blood, being considered in their spiritual and invisible vertue, and not in colours or features. But that spiritual vertue residing in the body and blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> are not represented by the figure, or by the colour of the bread and wine, but by their nutritive faculty; wherein they go beyond all other food.</p>

For through the rest of the whole Scripture, the Soul of <hi>Christ</hi> is never named but on occasion of his sufferings. Though he did not always suffer in the Body, yet his Soul was still sorrowful.</p>

                        <head>Twice onely the Angels appeared to <hi>Christ.</hi> The difference of those two Apparitions. An Observation thereupon.</head>
                        <p>IT's true, the Angels have rendred many services to <hi>Christ</hi> since his coming in the flesh, but they appeared but twice visibly to him; once, after his being tempted in the Wilderness, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.11. the other time, on the Eve of his death, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. The first time many Angels came to him, and ministered to him; but the second time, one Angel onely appeared to him, and yet afar off, namely, from heaven. In former times a whole Army of Angels went to meet <hi>Jacob, (Gen.</hi> 32.1, 2.) but <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Agony, one Angel onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him, and yet doth not come near him.</p>
                        <p>All this hath been a part of the abasing of <hi>Christ;</hi> and the nearer he came to the last degree of his humiliation, the more did the Angels draw away from him, one onely appearing then unto him, and yet at so far a distance. Moreover, in that that Angel came not out of heaven, but appeared to him in glory, whilst <hi>Christ</hi>
                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:98078:212"/>was so much humilitated, it may be seen, that then, more then at any other time before, was <hi>Christ</hi> made inferior to the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.</p>

                        <head>The Angels never spoke in the presence of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> A review of the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching that Angel that appeared to him.</head>
                        <p>'TIs an ordinary, though a rash pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that that Angel was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Christ,</hi> and uttering some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to him: but the History saith no such thing, but onely that that Angel appeared to <hi>Christ</hi> strengthning him. Some will ask, How did he strengthen him, but by speaking to him? <hi>Answer,</hi> The meer ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable apparition of an Angel did suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently shew to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from God's love towards him, and that was enough to strengthen him, without a necessity of the Angels speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. So did <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself appear from heaven to St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and yet spoke not to him, encouraging him by his meer apparition, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.55.</p>
                        <p>And when the Angels came to <hi>Christ</hi>
                           <pb n="159" facs="tcp:98078:212"/>in the Wilderness, and ministered to him, we do not read that any of them spake to him then; when they spoke, it was still in his absence: And so they said to the women that were looking for him in the grave, <hi>He is not here.</hi> So spoke they to the Apostles, after <hi>Christ</hi> was ascended into heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.10. But why they never spake in his presence, and much less to himself, we may say, that thereby they have shewed, that <hi>Christ</hi> received no kind of instruction from them. Several Prophets have been informed by the Angels thereunto appointed. But as to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> his knowledge, he had it immediately from God; and that it might appear that the Angels did contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, they have always kept their silence, wheresoever he was present.</p>

                        <head>Why did God pardon many of those that procured <hi>Christ</hi>'s death, and not <hi>Pilat</hi>'s wife, who opposed her self to that death?</head>
                        <p>GOd hath set in the way of salvation many thousand <hi>Jews,</hi> who had crucifi'd the Lord of glory, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23, 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 3.14, 15. and 4.4. And the same History rehearses, that there were a great number of Priests, whom we know were guiltier of the death of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                           <pb n="163" facs="tcp:98078:214"/>who were since brought to the obedience of Faith. Such were the effects of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, who was willing to save them through the same blood which they had spilt, and cause their crime, the most heinous that ever could be committed, to turn to their own salvation.</p>
                        <p>But if grace was shewed to those, to the murtherers of the righteous, to those that used him as a malefactor, why not also to that person, who alone pleaded for him on this occasion, and endeavoured to deliver him? Among many Answers that may be given to that Question, 'twill suffice now to say, that <hi>Pilat</hi>'s wife was onely moved therein by the fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, in case her husband should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn an innocent man; that such terror is far from the true motives of charity, and of the love of justice. Thus, among many persons that are guilty, God doth often pardon the guiltiest of all, and leaves others to the condemnation they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. In both he shews, that he hath power to shew mercy or justice, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the degrees of the offences.</p>

                        <p>WHen a man is so notoriously wicked, that in wickedness he surmounts all other men of his time, ordinarily he becomes his own Hangman. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentions five men, who, doubtless, were the wickedest men of their time, and all of them were their own murtherers. One <hi>Abimelech</hi> son of <hi>Gideon,</hi> who put to death seventy of his brethren. <hi>Saul,</hi> guilty of many notorious crimes. <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi> a Traitor, and an abhominable Counsellor. <hi>Zimri,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and extremely bloody.

                        <p>Let us add here an observation which is indifferent. In the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories, and in our own experience, there are more examples of women that have murdered themselves, then of men; this is observed by such as are curious. But we add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that the contrary is found in the Scripture; for in all the holy History, there is not an example of any woman that ever killed her self: not that that sex was so long a time without giving examples of such Tragedies, but because
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98078:215"/>it had no relation to any important matter of the History.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Here a question may be moved; The death of the High-priest freed the person that had committed man-slaughter; but if any had casually killed the High-priest himself, would that death have delivered the author of it? or would he have been necessitated to stay untill the death of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other High-priest?
